# 3e-notebooks
## A collection of Jupyter Notebooks referencing 3E

This is an attempt to show how to use Notebooks to retrieve and analyse data in Thomson Reuter's Elite 3E Time and Billing software application. These notebooks will not work from GitHub. The reader must download and import into their own Jupyter Notebook software.

I've experienced and read about GitHub having issues displaying Jupyter Notebooks, so there is a second link for each which launches out to Jupyter's Notebook viewer using the source here on GitHub.
