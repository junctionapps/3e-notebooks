# 3e-notebooks
## A collection of Jupyter Notebooks referencing 3E

This is an attempt to show how to use Notebooks to retrieve and analyse data in Thomson Reuter's Elite 3E Time and Billing software application. These notebooks will not work from GitHub. The reader must download and import into their own Jupyter Notebook software. In some cases, like the PDFExtract Notebook, there is no connection to 3E.

I've experienced and read about GitHub having issues displaying Jupyter Notebooks, so there is a second link for each which launches out to Jupyter's Notebook viewer using the source here on GitHub.

I invite you to create an issue using the GitHub Issues tracker if anything is worded oddly, outright wrong, or could have further clarification. These are mostly written in the hours between putting kids to bed and drifting off to sleep.
