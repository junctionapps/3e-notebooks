    "# Create a Graph with Pandas and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a \"library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\" I use it instead of dumping data out to Excel. For me, having data manipulations well documented and repeatable is much easier to accomplish through Python code than a set of instructions writen in Word and completed in Excel. I know Excel is great, and I've used it for years, but it has become uneeded for most of my work now thanks to Pandas. Recognizing Excel is still in heavy use, Pandas does provide easy utilities to read and write to Excel files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't get deep into the data analysis part of Pandas and what it can really do in this notebook. We are going to create a simple graph representing aged WIP for a single timekeeper. Such a graph can be published to a static report, sent via email, or embedded in a PDF as part of a timekeeper's factsheet for the compensation committee.\n",

Pandas' `plot` method is a wrapper around matplotlib's `pyplot.plot()` so when looking at the documentation, the two have many interchangeable things, but some are not available in the wrapper and you need to use calls like  `plt.show()` or `plt.savefig()`. There are lots of options and settings, but by example here is how a bar chart could be created.
