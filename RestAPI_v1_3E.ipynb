    "# Using Python to call 3E's Rest API\n",
    "**NOTE:** The following assumes decent usage of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "At time of writing there isn't much documentation on how to use the Rest API for 3e. Below are a few samples of some calls to create, retrieve and update. The list of examples will grow within this notebook as time permits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of articles in the Thomson Reuters Knowledge base that cover a few of the basics. Specifically:\n",
    "- TR-19784 : How to obtain access to 3E APIs \n",
    "- TR-19969 : ASG - 3E OData - Troubleshooting Guide (E) \n",
    "- TR-19847 : 3E API & OData - A Primer for Developers \n",
    "- TR-19363 : Using Postman to Demo 3E API Connections \n",
    "\n",
    "For this sample, we'll use NTLM authentication, simply because that's all that is available currently. If you've got a cloud instance, you'd go through the authentication to get your token. See the section in TR-19847 for more information on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this will be saved to the internet, credentials and instance urls are tucked into another Python file in the same folder as this one. Use whatever method you like to accomplish this hiding of credentials, whether that be environment variables, calls out to third party password managers, or read from a database. For simplicity, I'm using a service account with limited permissons. The `environment.py` file looks a little like the following:\n",
