    # Key concepts
    This section provides information about the key iManage Work concepts required to understand and to efficiently work on iManage Work API requests.

    ## Differences between GET and POST search
    There are both GET and POST versions of certain searches. Consider the following aspects of each to identify the version to be used:

    GET:
    * GET endpoints are simpler and easier to implement.
    * Some GET endpoints return facets that provide certain criteria to users to refine their search results.
      Facets list the most relevant five properties of iManage Work objects, which provide users with the option to narrow results
      by several dimensions simultaneously.
      For example, a document search can return the `custom1` facet.
      It returns the aggregated result of documents based on the five most logical and relevant custom1 aliases.
      Facets can be used to anticipate user selections, or to present a list of suggestions that the user will likely select.
      For example, frequent custom1 aliases can be added at the top of a selection list, so that users do not have to scroll through the entire list.

    POST:
    * Use POST if you are making a series of searches, or require many search filters. In this scenario, POST is preferred over GET, as it is quicker and less stressful for the iManage Work system.
    * POST allows a greater number of search filters through several available mechanisms:
      * Query parameters 
      * The `filter` parameter
      * A greater number of items for each filter. For example, <a href="#post-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/users/search">POST /work/api/v2/customers/{customerId}/users/search</a> accepts an array with many user IDs. By contrast, <a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/users">GET /work/api/v2/customers/{customerId}/users</a> is restricted to the request character limit of the endpoint.
    * Some endpoints support selecting which fields to return using the `profile_fields` request parameter.
      Returning specific fields can make parsing the response easier, and is less stressful for the iManage Work system.

    ## External users
    External users are temporary team members, consultants, or those external to the organization.
    External users do not have default access to any container or document. They must be explicitly granted access
    for each container or document, including those marked as Public or View.

    ## Privileges
    A privilege is a permission to perform a set of tasks.<br>
    In iManage Work, the privileges available to users are classified under two main categories:

    * **Role privileges**<br>
      A role is a named set of privileges that can be assigned to users.
      There are two types of role privileges available:
      * **Global-level** - For more information, see <a href="#tag--Global-Roles">Global Roles</a>.
      * **Library-level** - For more information, see <a href="#tag--Library-Roles">Library Roles</a>.

    * **Object-level privileges**<br>
      Object-level privileges are access levels users and groups have on containers and documents.
      The access levels are set by the owner of the object or a user having full access privileges on the object.

      The available object-level access levels are listed below:

    | Access levels | Description |
    |---------------|-------------|
    | full_access   | Users with full access have the same rights as the owner to control the content and perform the following actions: <br>* Add items <br>* Edit security <br>* Delete a workspace, folder, or document |
    | read_write    | Users can view, create subfolders, add and edit contents of the folders and subfolders, and delete documents.|
    | read          | Users can view contents but not add, edit or remove items.|
    | no_access     | Users can neither view contents nor see the existence of a document.|

    ## Types of groups
    **Global groups**<br>
    Global groups are created and managed independently of any iManage Work library, and changes made to the global group are
    updated at the global level, and not individually within each library. For more information, see  <a href="#tag--Global-Groups">Global Groups</a>.

    **Library groups**<br>
    Library-level groups are created for a specific library and can be assigned to workspaces, containers, and documents within that library.
    For more information, see  <a href="#tag--Library-Groups">Library Groups</a>.

    ## Preferred library
    A preferred library is the user's default library. Each user is required to have one preferred library.
    It stores the user's preferred settings, such as language preference and default search form for iManage Work advanced searches.

    If a user's preferred library is switched to another, the preferences are reset.

    ## Global Settings
    The following settings are defined by the iManage Work system.
    The combination of the presence or absence of the setting itself, and the value of the setting indicates their behavior.

    |Setting name|Data type|Description|
    |:--|:--|:--|
    |im.email.domain|string|The email domain used by the customer for filing inbound and outbound emails.<br><br>If present, uses the value specified.<br>If not present, defaults to `http://mail.cloudimanage.com/`.|
    |im.email.filingFolder.defaultName|string|The default email filing folder for a workspace which is matched by name/pattern per customer. For example: e-mail.<br><br>If present, uses the value specified.<br>If present, it uses the specified value.<br>If not present, defaults to `Email*`.|
    |im.email.types|string|The file types of emails. All file types included in this value will be considered email types. The value uses a comma-separated list. For example, it can be like `MIME`, or `MIME,GW`.<br><br>If present, uses the value specified.<br>If not present, defaults to `MIME,GW,NOTES,EML`.|
    |im.email.useBccForFiling|Boolean|The way an email is to be filed. The owner's email domain is automatically added to the email addresses in the BCC or the CC field.<br><br>If `true`, automatically file the email.<br>If `false`, do not automatically file the email.<br>If not present, defaults to `false`.|
    |im.feature.flexibleFolders|Boolean|Whether users are allowed to use the flexible folder functionality (templates) to create workspaces.<br><br>If `true`, the user is allowed to use templates during workspace creation.<br>If `false`, the user is not allowed to use templates during workspace creation.<br>If not present, defaults to `false`.|
    |im.policy.requireFullAccessToCreateRootLevelFolder|Boolean|The minimum access rights to a workspace that are required for users to create root-level folders, search folders, Share folders, and tabs..<br><br>If `true`, only users with a permissions level of Full Access to a workspace can create root level folders.<br>If `false`, users with a minimum permissions level of Read/Write to a workspace can create root level folders.<br><br> If no existing permissions level setting exists, defaults to `false`.|
    |im.document.versionEditing|string|Whether to allow editing of a document based on its document version. This includes content, properties, default security, and access permissions. Allowed values are `yes`, `no`, and `latestVersionOnly`.<br><br>If `yes`, all versions of the document can be edited.<br>If `no`, none of the versions can be edited.<br>If `latestVersionOnly`, only the latest version of the document can be edited.|
    |im.document.defaultDocumentClass|string|The default document class to be applied to documents when they are uploaded to iManage Work.<br><br> This default document class is applicable to all libraries. Therefore, it must be present on all libraries and it can be set only by the system administrator who is part of the NRTADMIN group on all libraries.|
    |im.diagnostics.enableAnalytics|Boolean|Enables usage analytics to be collected and shared with iManage. This information is used for improving iManage products. No customer information, such as document or workspace names, is collected. The data is in aggregated form. Therefore, users and customers are not directly identifiable.<br><br>If `true`, enables usage analytics to be collected and shared with iManage.<br>If `false`, disables usage analytics to be collected and shared with iManage.<br>If not present, defaults to `true`.

    ## Facets
    Facets are a summary list of the most common occurrences of the specified object property.
    For example, if the facet `custom1` is specified in a search, then occurrences of all possible values
    of `custom1` within the result set are counted. The top five most common values of the `custom1` property are returned.<br>
    Facets provide suggestions for narrowing down search criteria that the user will likely select.

    Multiple facets can be specified using a comma-separated list.
    For example: `facets=senders,types,owners`.
    Possible values are: `senders`, `owners`, `types`, `class`, `subclass`, `custom1`, `custom2`, `custom3`, `custom4`,
    `custom5`, `custom6`, `custom7`, `custom8`, `custom9`, `custom10`, `custom11`, `custom12`, `custom29`, and `custom30`.

    The `facets` parameter is often used along with the `results` parameter.
    If neither of the parameters are specified, only the search results are returned.
    If `results=false`, and a facet value is specified, only the facet's information is returned.
    If both the parameters are specified, both facets and search results are returned.

    <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request</font><br>
    In the following example, to search for documents, the facets `senders` and `types` are specified:

    `GET https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/recent-documents?results=false&facets=senders,types`

    <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample response</font><br>
    ```
    {
      "data": {
        "facets": {
          "senders": [],
          "types"  : [
            {
              "alias"      : "ANSI",
              "count"      : 132,
              "description": "Windows Ansi Text"
            },
            {
              "alias"      : "EML",
              "count"      : 2,
              "description": "EML"
            },
            {
              "alias"      : "ACROBAT",
              "count"      : 1,
              "description": "Adobe Acrobat Reader"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Notice in the response that no senders were returned. This indicates there were no senders to return even though the search asked for them. The request will succeed even when a requested facet is not there. In this case, the other facet in the request had some hits. Three document `types` are returned, with "ANSI" being the most common at 132 instances.

    ## Pagination
    The iManage REST API uses different pagination schemes to navigate between the pages of requested data, depending on the specific endpoint being used. In this documentation, you will see pagination as a part of many endpoints' functionality. This section describes pagination in detail.

    An endpoint that returns paginated results uses one of the following pagination schemes:

    * *Explicit overflow with optional cursor*: The response always contains the overflow field. When overflow is true, then the cursor field is present.
    * *Explicit overflow with required cursor*: The response always contains both the overflow and cursor fields. That is, the cursor is present regardless of the value of the overflow field.
      * This type of overflow is intended for continuous scrolling of new results.
      * As the cursor is present even when there are no additional records, the client application may use this cursor to periodically poll for the next page.
      * When new records fitting the search criteria are found while using the cursor to poll, they will be present in the response, along with a new cursor.
      * The new cursor can again be used to either retrieve the next page (if overflow is true) or to continue polling.
    * *Cursor with implied overflow*: Some requests result in a response that contains a cursor field that is populated if additional records exist beyond the page returned. In other words, the presence/absence of a cursor implies whether there is an overflow.

    You can identify the pagination type used by a particular endpoint through the individual parameters it uses, as listed on the reference page for that specific endpoint. Refer to the following tables for additional information about the specifics of these schemes as they relate to pagination.

    ### Request parameters for pagination
    |Query parameter| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    |---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |`offset`| The number of results to skip in the total result set. For example, a search may find 300 items. Using the default (offset=0) will not skip any items and return items starting with the first item. A value of offset=50 skips the first 50 items and returns items starting with the 51st position. If the offset exceeds the number of items in the list, no items will be returned. <br>The default is `offset=0`. |
    |`limit`| The number of records to be returned in the response. For example, a search may find 300 items, but `limit=10` will only return ten of those 300 items. <br>This parameter always has a default value that is defined by the specific endpoint. A common default is `limit=25`, but can vary depending on the endpoint being used, as stated in the details for the specific endpoint.                                 |
    |`total`| A boolean parameter specifying whether or not the total number of matches should be returned. Specifying `total=true` can be helpful in cases where you need to know the exact number of matches. For example, if you want to display the number in a user interface or determine the number of pages your search will produce.<br>The default value is `total=false`.                                                 |
    |`cursor`| A unique identifier that points to a location in a record set, dataset, and so on, provided by an endpoint's response to the request. Used by the system to find the starting point from which to retrieve data.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

    ### Response fields for pagination
    | Response field | Description |
    |----------------|-------------|
    | `overflow`     | This field may be returned with the search results for endpoints that use the overflow pagination scheme. If the number of items returned by the search is more than the limit value, `overflow` will be `true`. This flag indicates that you have additional items that can be returned.<br>Requests returning `overflow` do not support the `total` parameter.|
    | `total_count`  | The total number of items found. This field is present in the response if the request specifies `total=true`. If the result set spans multiple pages, the value of this field will be greater than the number of items on one page. For example, if a search request with `limit=10` matched 50 records, then the response will contain `"total_count": 50` with only 10 of the records that matched the search criteria. |
    | `cursor`       | A unique identifier that points to a location in a record set, dataset, and so on, provided by an endpoint's response. <br>The response fills this field with a valid value in two distinct scenarios: <br> 1. When *explicit* overflow is used (when the endpoint response contains the `overflow` field), or <br> 2. When the endpoint uses a cursor-always pagination scheme.|

    ### Example
    The following shows <a href="#post-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/users/search">POST /work/api/v2/customers/{customerId}/users/search</a> using the paging parameters `offset`, `limit`, and `total`.

    `POST https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/users`
    Request body:
    ```
    {
      "filters": {
          "full_name": "Andrew Case"
      },
      "paging": {
        "limit": 50,
        "total": true
      }
    }
    ```

    The request defines a search based on the full name "Andrew Case", and returns up to 50 items (`limit` parameter). The `offset` value of zero starts the search with the first item in the system. Therefore, the items are displayed starting from the beginning of the list. It also returns the total number of matches in the response, as specified by the parameter `total=true`. This count will be in the response field, also named `total` as described in the table above.

    ## Rate limiting
    Rate limiting is a technique to limit the rate of API requests that are processed by iManage Work. The client applications should
    implement the support to handle rate limits to avoid poor user experience, as requests are continually retried by iManage Work
    until a certain period before they succeed. The iManage Universal API provides the necessary data to support rate limiting algorithms.

    ###  Availability of rate limiting support
    Rate limiting support is currently available for specific environments.<br>
    To check its availability in your environment, execute <a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/features">GET /work/api/v2/customers/{customerId}/features</a>.<br>
    If the feature flag `rate_limiting` is `true`, then it is supported in your environment.

    ### What information is provided to support rate limiting?
    During normal operation, applications make API requests and receive responses in a regular way.

    For successful API requests, the response status code 200 - Success is returned along with the following response headers:

    | Response header         | Description |
    |-------------------------|-------------|
    | `x-ratelimit-remaining` | Indicates the number of requests remaining in the current time window.|
    | `x-ratelimit-reset`     | Indicates the number of seconds an application must wait before making any further requests. <br>This header helps you to understand and estimate when future requests might have rate limiting applied.<br>A low value should be interpreted as a warning sign for either the number of requests issued in the time window or the request throughput.<br>As the `x-ratelimit-remaining` value gets smaller, the `x-ratelimit-reset` indicates when the `x-ratelimit-remaining` number will be reset to the full current capacity.|

    Here is a sample response to a successful DELETE request showing rate limiting information:

    ```
    $ curl -i -X DELETE `https://ajubalaw.com/work/web/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/ACTIVE_US/documents/ACTIVE_US!10817.1` 
                         -H "Host: ajubalaw.com" -H "X-Auth-Token: RuVRhrkMeQXQBpWguPVfcnCrvgqFdUaDIEPlVPtpFE"
      HTTP/2 200
      strict-transport-security: max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains
      date: Tue, 23 Nov 2021 13:26:33 GMT
      content-length: 0
      cache-control: no-cache, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-store
      x-ratelimit-remaining: 9
      x-ratelimit-reset: 10
    ```

    ### What happens when rate limits are exceeded?

    When rate limits are exceeded, a standard HTTP status code response of `429 - Too many requests` message is
    sent to the client application. 

    Additionally, the response header `x-rate-limit-reset` value indicates the
    number of seconds an application must wait before making any further requests.

    ##### **Sample response when rate limit is enforced**

    Here is a sample request and response to delete a document with the rate limit exceeded from previous requests:

    ````
    $ curl -i -X DELETE `https://ajubalaw.com/work/web/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/ACTIVE_US/documents/ACTIVE_US!10817.1`
                        -H "Host: ajubalaw.com" -H "X-Auth-Token: RuVRhrkMeQXQBpWguPVfcnCrvgqFdUaDIEPlVPtpFE"
      HTTP/2 429 Too Many Requests
      strict-transport-security: max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains
      date: Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:08:00 GMT
      content-length: 0
      x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
      x-ratelimit-reset: 35
    ````

    ### How can you shape your traffic to counter the rate limit?

    When making requests, you should observe the headers returned by iManage Work and adjust your code specifically to the number of remaining requests you can make before rate limiting is triggered.

    * **Monitor**: Make requests and monitor all response headers.
    * **Adjust**: With every request, recalculate the rate based on the headers.
    * **Retry**: If you encounter a `429 Too Many Requests` message, which should not happen if you used the headers correctly, further adjust your code. You can use the `x-ratelimit-reset` header to make sure that you only make requests when the iManage Work services are available.

    ### Best practices for rate limiting

    * **Use the `x-ratelimit-remaining` response header**<br>
      Continuously monitor the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header in your code. If this value drops to a very low number,
      reduce the number of requests being sent.

    * **Check for errors caused by rate limits**<br>
      For responses that generate the `429 - Too Many Requests` response code, rate limits have been exceeded.
      Include logic in your code to detect this response code and then resubmit the request after `x-ratelimit-reset` number of seconds.

    * **Reduce the number of requests**<br>
      Optimize your code to eliminate unnecessary requests by doing the following:
      * Cache frequently used data.
      * Save relatively static information in a database.
      * Serialize the information in a file.

    * **Regulate the request rate**<br>
      If you regularly encounter the `429 - Too Many Requests` error, consider including a process in your code that
      regulates the rate of your requests so that they are distributed more evenly over time.

      summary: Get access token
      description: |-
        Gets an access token from iManage platform.

        The recieved token is passed as the `X-Auth-Token` header in most of the subsequent requests in order to 
        authenticate the caller's identity and determine their privileges.<br>
        The life span of access tokens is configured by your system administrator. If it expires, you can re-execute
        this endpoint to get the new access token.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">OAuth2 grant types supported by iManage</font><br>
        iManage supports following OAuth2 grant types (see `grant_type` request parameter) for retrieving access tokens
        per the relevant RFC specifications:

        | Grant Type | Specifications |
        |:---|:---|
        | SAML | RFC 7522 |
        | Authorization Code with PKCE support | RFC 6749, RFC 7636 |
        | Password | RFC 6749 |
        | Refresh Token | RFC 6749 |

        The RFC specifications provide most of the details required for executing token requests. However, some details
        differ in the iManage implementation. Details of some of these differences that are applicable are as follows:

        * **All grant types, except Refresh Token**<br>
          * `client_id` request parameter is required.
          * `client_secret` request parameter is required if the client is a web application.

        * **SAML Grant**<br>
          `customer_id` request parameter is required.

        * **Authorization Code Grant**<br>
          PKCE is required for native client applications and strongly suggested for all other client types.

        * **Password Grant**<br>
          The password grant can only be used for users that are not synchronized with an external IDP,
          or if the IDP uses the OIDC protocol with Direct Grant support.

        * **Refresh Token**<br>
          When exchanging a refresh token for a new access token, the provided refresh token will be revoked.
          A new refresh token will be returned, along with the new access token.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Required authorization</font><br>
        The user must have a valid iManage account, and `allow_logon` must be `true` for this account.<br>
        For more information, see <a href="#tag--Users">Users</a> and <a href="#tag--Library-Users">Library Users</a>

        <font style="color:black;size:5">Text Searches</font><br>
        Text searches have the following characteristics:
        * Case insensitive. The search string *Jennifer* search will find *Jennifer*, *jennifer*, or *jennIFER*.
        * Whole words only. The search string *Jen* search will find *Jen* but not *Jennifer*.
        * Support the wildcard character (&ast;). This character finds any number of contiguous string characters.
        The search string *Jen&ast;* search will find *Jen* and *Jennifer*.<br>
        The search string &ast; (an &ast; by itself) will find that property that has any characters in it, and so leaves out empty properties.<br>
        For example, `custom3=*` will find all custom3 properties that have any value.<br>

          This applies only to workspace and document searches.
          For workspace template searches, this parameter is the same as the parameter `name_or_description`.

          This search is case insensitive and matches whole words. The wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.
          This parameter searches indexed properties and the user is required to have their role's **Allow Full Text Search** privilege enabled.

        name: create_date
        in: query
        description: |
          Specifies a date range to search relative to the current date.<br><br>
          A DateRange function specifies a date/time range expressed in an amount of time before the current date/time, and up through an amount of time before the current date/time.
          For example, this could specify a create date between 30 days prior to the current time and up to the current time.<br><br>
          This parameter has a format of `[begin]:[end][time units]`.
          These values are relative to each other, and do not refer to calendar dates.
          For example, `-30:0d`, indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to today,
          and up through the user's current date/time, measured in days.<br>

          |Value|Description|
          |:---|:---|
          |begin|The earliest date/time, noted as negative value from today.|
          |end|The latest date/time, noted as negative value from today, or using 0 for today|
          |time units|The time unit to use. This may be `d` for days, `m` for month, or `y` for years.|

          Examples:<br>
          * `create_date=-30:0d` indicates a create date/time range from 30 days prior to the current date/time and through the current date/time.<br>
          * `edit_date=-30:-7d` indicates an edit date/time range from 30 days prior to the current date/time and through seven days prior to the current date/time.<br>
          * `custom21_relative=-15:1d` indicates a custom21 property value date/time range from 15 days prior to the current date/time and through one day after the current date/time (or one day in the future).<br>

          A positive value can be used for [begin] or [end].
          A date/time specifying a future period would generally limit the search up through the user's current date/time.
          However, due to time changes or time zone differences, it may be possible for an item to appear to have a future date/time relative to the user by up to one day.
          In those cases, a value like `-30:1d` may be applicable.

          Specifies a value for the custom20 property.<br><br>
          The use of this property is customized for your iManage Work installation.<br><br>
          The date can be specified in one of two formats.
          * The standard iManage ISO 8601 format. This is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.µZ.
          µ represents zero or more microseconds.
          For example: 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229Z
          * The standard iManage ISO 8601 format with offset. This is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.µ∓hh.mm.
          µ represents zero or more microseconds.
          For example: 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229+02.00.
          The values at the end are an offset (to the nearest minute), moving the time ahead or behind.
          This can be used to inline the time difference.
          For example, India is five and half hours ahead of London, so a date from London can be set to 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229+05.30 to match Indian time.

          This is a date/time property in an ISO 8601 format value. For example, `2018-05-24T00:00:00-08:00`.<br>

          When searching, this parameter specifies the earliest value to search from.
          For example, specifying 2018-05-24T00:00:00-08:00 (Saturday May 24, 2018 00:00:00 PST) returns only items

          You can specify a date/time range by using *property_name*_from for the lower limit and *property_name*_to for the upper limit.
          This is applicable for each custom21, custom22, custom23, custom24.

          This property is not reserved by iManage Work and is not a validated value.
          It is intended to be customized for your company's requirements.
          This is a date/time property in an ISO 8601 format value. For example, `2018-05-24T00:00:00-08:00`.<br>

          This parameter has a format of `[begin]:[end][time units]`.
          These values are relative to each other, and do not refer to calendar dates.
          For example, `-30:0d`, indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to today (that is, within the last 30 days),
          and up through the user's current date/time, measured in days.

          |Value|Description|Example|
          |:---|:---|:---|
          |begin|The earliest date/time, noted as negative value from today.|-30, -7|
          |end|The latest date/time, noted as negative value from today, or using 0 for today|-30, -7, 0, 1|
          |time units|The time unit to use. This may be `d` for days, `m` for month, or `y` for years.|d, m, y|

          Examples:<br>
          * `custom21_relative=-30:0d` indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to the current date/time and through the current date/time.<br>
          *  `custom21_relative=-30:-7d` indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to the current date/time and through seven days prior to the current date/time.<br>
          * `custom21_relative=-15:1d` indicates a date/time range from 15 days prior to the current date/time and through one day after the current date/time (or one day in the future).<br>

          A positive value can be used for [begin] or [end].
          A date/time specifying a future period would generally limit the search up through the user's current date/time.
          However, due to time changes or time zone differences, it may be possible for an item to appear to have a future date/time relative to the user.
          In those cases, a value like `-30:1d` may be reasonable.

          The search with `description=litigation` matches only *litigation*.
          The search with `description=litiga` does not match any variation.

        description: |
          Specifies an edit date range relative to the current date.<br>

          This parameter has a format of `[begin]:[end][time units]`.
          These values are relative to each other, and do not refer to calendar dates.
          For example, `-30:0d`, indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to today (that is, within the last 30 days),
          and up through the user's current date/time, measured in days.<br>

          |Value|Description|Example|
          |:---|:---|:---|
          |begin|The earliest date/time, noted as negative value from today.|-30, -7|
          |end|The latest date/time, noted as negative value from today, or using 0 for today|-30, -7, 0, 1|
          |time units|The time unit to use. This may be `d` for days, `m` for month, or `y` for years.|d, m, y|

          Examples:<br>
          * `custom21_relative=-30:0d` indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to the current date/time and through the current date/time.
          * `custom21_relative=-30:-7d` indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to the current date/time and through seven days prior to the current date/time.
          * `custom21_relative=-15:1d` indicates a date/time range from 15 days prior to the current date/time and through one day after the current date/time (or one day in the future).

          A positive value can be used for [begin] or [end].
          A date/time specifying a future period would generally limit the search up through the user's current date/time.
          However, due to time changes or time zone differences, it may be possible for an item to appear to have a future date/time relative to the user.
          In those cases, a value like `-30:1d` may be reasonable.

        description: |
          Specifies which facets to return.

          Facets are a summary list of the most common occurrences for each facet type listed.
          For example, if `facets` specifies custom1, all items containing any value for custom1 are counted.
          The five items with the highest counts are returned.
          Facets allow users to anticipate selections, or to present a list of suggestions that the user will likely select.

          Multiple facets can be included using a comma-separated list.
          For example: `facets=custom1,custom2,custom9`.
          If this parameter is omitted, which is the default value, no facets are returned.
          Possible values are: custom1, custom2, custom3, custom4, custom5, custom6, custom7, custom8, custom9, custom10, custom11, custom12, custom29, and custom30.

          This parameter is often used along with the `results` parameter.
          If neither of the parameters are included, only the search results are returned.
          If `results=false`, and a facets value is specified, only the facets information is returned.
          If both the parameters are specified, both facets and search results are returned.
          If `results=false` and no valid facets parameters are specified, no data of either type is returned. However, an empty response object is returned.<br>

          <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request</font><br>
          In this example, the search is GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/recent-workspaces?results=false&facets=custom1,custom9`.
          The response JSON object does not include any search results.
          The facets section specified returning custom9 but there are no custom9 values to return.
          However, three custom1 values are returned, with *Microsoft* being the most common with 132 instances.

          This value indicates the starting position for the first item to return from among all the possible items.
          By default, this value is zero, meaning items are returned starting from the first item in the list.
          For example, if the offset is ten (`offset=10`), the first item returned will be the 11th item in the list.
          The `offset` is often used in combination with the `limit` parameter.

        Returns all workspaces that match the specified criteria.<br>

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Feature availability </font><br>
        This request is available for specific environments.<br>
        Prior to executing this request, check&nbsp;<a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/features">GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`</a>.<br>
        If `global_users` is `true`, this request is available in your environment.
        <br>

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        To return all workspaces the user has access to, and to return only the two default profile fields `id` and `wstype`:<br>
        POST `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/workspaces/search`<br>
        The request body is empty:<br>
        ```
        {
        }
        ```

        <br>To return all workspaces in the library active_us that the user has access to, and to return the additional profile fields `edit_dat`, `name`, and `database`:<br>
        POST `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/workspaces/search`<br>
        Request body:<br>
        ```
        {
          "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
          "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "edit_date", "name", "database"] }
        }
        ```

        <br><font style="color:black;size:5">Search filters</font><br>
        The body parameter `filters` specifies the set of search criteria.
        Each search criterion is a separate field in the filters parameter.
        The following request body specifies to search for a workspace within the specified library:<br>
        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "libraries": "active"
          }
        }
        ```
        <br><font style="color:black;size:5">Profile Fields Display</font><br>
        The `profile_fields` parameter specifies the set of fields to return in the response object.
        As the number of available fields to return can be large, some of the fields may not be required.
        The `profile_fields` parameter explicitly specifies the fields to return.
        The field does not have to be one of the search criterion.
        For example, the following search filters on the workspace's library but the library name is not returned in the response.
        By default, workspaces automatically return the `id` and `wstype`. For example, the following request body:<br>

        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "libraries": "active"
          }
        }
        ```

        returns something similar to this:<br>

        ```
        {
            "data": [
                {
                    "id": "active!1331436",
                    "wstype": "workspace"
                }
            ],
            "overflow": true
        }
        ```

        Any additional fields must be specified. Fields are specified by the object type.
        There are five work types: document, folder, workspace, email, and user.
        For each object type, include a list of fields.
        For example, the following request body specifies returning three additional fields for a workspace object:<br>

        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "libraries": "active"
          },
            "profile_fields" :  {
            "workspace"  :  ["edit_date", "name", "database"]
          }
        }
        ```

        returns something similar to this:<br>

        ```
        {
            "data": [
                {
                    "database": "Active",
                    "name": "Filing Procedures",
                    "id": "active!1331436",
                    "edit_date": "2018-11-07T17:27:11.008Z",
                    "wstype": "workspace"
                }
            ],
            "overflow": true
        }
        ```

        There can be up to five object types for each `profile_fields` parameter.
        For more information, see the description of parameter `profile_fields`.
        Searches that do not return object types from among those specified, are ignored.
        For example, if a search does not return any folder types, no folder profile fields are returned even if they are specified.
        The following request body specifies returning profile fields for two objects types, and for each objects type, which fields to return.
        These are in addition to default fields.<br>

        ```
        {
          "limit": 150,
          "filters": { "libraries": "active"},
          "profile_fields" :
            {
              "workspace"  :  ["edit_date", "name"],
              "folder"  :  ["create_date", "owner"]
            }
        }
        ```

                    iManage Work returns date values in UTC. Timezone offset can be used to translate UTC to the local time for display in the client application.

                    For example, India is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC, which is 330 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=330`.

                    Specifies fields to return in the response JSON.<br><br>
                    Some searches could return many fields, and not all are of interest for the search.
                    Therefore, this request specifies the fields to return.
                    By default, only the `id` and `wstype` fields are included.<br><br>
                    If more fields are needed to be returned, use the parameter `profile_fields` to specify those.
                    The parameter `profile_fields` is not required. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.
                    Items found during the search are still returned even if the search field specifying them is not included in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, the search can specify `owner=acase` but it does not have to include `owner` in the `profile_fields`.<br><br>

                    To return additional fields, specify both the object type and the fields in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, for the following request body specifies returning the `name` and `owner` fields.
                    This is in addition to the two default `id` and `wstype` fields.

                      "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
                      "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "name", "owner"] }
                    }
                    ```
                    The parameter `profile_fields` can contain multiple entries, one for each of the following object types.<br><br>

                    |Type|Description|
                    |:---|:---|
                    |document|A document object.|
                    |email|A document object.|
                    |folder|A folder object.|
                    |workspace|A workspace object.|
                    |user|A user object.|

                    For each object type, specify additional fields.
                    If an object type is included but no objects of that type are returned, that object type entry is ignored.<br>

                    Multiple object types can also be included. The following example specifies the return fields for workspace and email:
                    ```
                    {
                      "profile_fields":
                      {
                        "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ],
                        "email": [ "sender", "title" ]
                      }
                    }
                    ```

                    The parameter `profile_fields` is often combined with the parameter `filters`, which defines the search criteria.
                    The following example returns workspaces that meet the `filters` criteria, and returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response:
                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields":
                        {
                          "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ]
                        },
                        "filters":
                        {
                          "custom1": "Enron",
                          "name": "Acquisitions"
                        }
                    }

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        This parameter has a format of `[begin]:[end][time units]`.
                        These values are relative to each other, and do not refer to calendar dates.
                        For example, `-30:0d`, indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to today (that is, within the last 30 days),
                        and up through the user's current date/time, measured in days.

                        |Value|Description|Example|
                        |:---|:---|:---|
                        |begin|The earliest date/time, noted as negative value from today.|-30, -7|
                        |end|The latest date/time, noted as negative value from today, or using 0 for today|-30, -7, 0, 1|
                        |time units|The time unit to use. This is `d` for days, `m` for month, or `y` for years.|d, m, y|

                        Examples:<br>
                        * `custom21_relative=-30:0d` indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to the current date/time and through the current date/time.
                        * `custom21_relative=-30:-7d` indicates a date/time range from 30 days prior to the current date/time and through seven days prior to the current date/time.
                        * `custom21_relative=-15:1d` indicates a date/time range from 15 days prior to the current date/time and through one day after the current date/time (or one day in the future).

                        A positive value can be used for [begin] or [end].
                        A date/time specifying a future period would generally limit the search up through the user's current date/time.
                        However, due to time changes or time zone differences, it is possible for an item to appear to have a future date/time relative to the user.
                        In those cases, a value like `-30:1d` is reasonable.
                      example: -30:0d

                        The `name` parameter is also known as `title` in some iManage Work clients.

                        Specifies documents of the document type.<br><br>

                        Each iManage Work system has a customizable list of document types per the organizational requirements.
                        For example, *Word*, *WordX*, *Acrobat*, *Powerpoint*. <br>
                        These values are not necessarily the same as the document type's extension field, which may be *doc*, *docx*, *pdf*, or *ppt*.<br>
                        Document type is not case sensitive, that is, *Word* matches with *word*.<br>
                        There is no stemming and the wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.
                        For example, *acrob* or *acrob&#42;* does not match *acrobat*.<br>
                        Multiple document types can be included using a comma-separated list.
                        For example, *type=WORD,WORDX,WORDXT*

                        <br>
                        To get a complete list of document types for a library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/types`.

                        This parameter allows for a document-only return list.
                        For an email-only return list, see the `email_only` parameter.

                      description: |-
                        Indicates the document number of a document.

                        Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
                        and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
                        Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>
                        For example, if library ID is ACTIVE_UK, document number is 72634, and document version is 3, then document ID is `ACTIVE_UK!72634.3`.
                      example: 4563
                    document_version:
                      type: integer
                      description: |-
                        Specifies the document version number.<br><br>
                        The document version number is the number of times a document has been edited.
                        For example, if the document ID is `active!72634.3`, the document version number is 3.<br><br>

                        When specifying document version numbers, either a single value can be included (`document_number=1`), or
                        a comma-separated list may be used to specify multiple document version numbers (`document_number=1,3`).

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:

                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                    If a `filters` parameter is included, returns only items matching all the filters.
                    For example, the following returns only items with a custom1 alias of *Enron* and has the name of *Acquisitions*.<br><br>

                    ```
                      {

                    ```

                    The parameter `filters` is often combined with the parameter `profile_fields`, which returns specified fields in the response object.
                    The following example returns documents that meet the `filters` requirements.
                    If this is a workspace object, it also returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response.

                    ```

      summary: Create a global user
      description: |
        Creates an iManage Work user.<br>

        The global privileges required to implement this request: User Management.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Feature availability </font><br>
        This request is available for specific environments.<br>
        Prior to executing this request, check&nbsp;<a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/features">GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`</a>.<br>
        If `global_users` is `true`, this request is available in your environment.
        <br>

        A global level user is the one who has not been assigned to any library, and exists at the global level in iManage Work.
        The user can be later assigned to a library.
        One of the following two types of users may be created:

        **Virtual user**<br>
        The users are created and managed in iManage Work. The virtual users are authenticated against passwords stored in iManage Work. They are not part of the organization's directory service.
        These are typically external users who are not part of the organization and are included for a specific purpose and for a defined period of time. For example, auditors, interns, and contractors.
        This user is created at the global level, and must be manually assigned to a library. A virtual user can be converted to an enterprise user by changing their user type (`nos`) value from 2 to 6.

        **Enterprise user**<br>
        An enterprise user is created and managed within the organization's directory service.
        The enterprise users are authenticated against the IDP configured by an organization.
        This type of user is managed by the organization's network administrators, such as for changing names, and creating or deleting users.
        The iManage Work system accepts and provides updates through a series of automated user imports and exports.
        An enterprise user can be converted to a virtual user by changing their user type (`nos`) from 6 to 2.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        The following is the minimal request required to create virtual user MARCIEDAVENPORT:<br>
        POST `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/users`<br>
        Request body:
        ```
        {
          "id": "MARCIEDAVENPORT",
          "full_name": "Marcie Davenport",
          "user_id_ex": "MARCIEDAVENPORT",

          "preferred_library": "active_uk",
          "user_nos": 2
        }
        ```
        The request returns the response body with the new user's information:
        ```
        {

                        This value indicates the starting position for the first item to return from among all the possible items.
                        By default, this value is zero, meaning items are returned starting from the first item in the list.
                        For example, if the offset is ten (`offset=10`), the first item returned will be the 11th item in the list.
                        The `offset` is often used in combination with the `limit` parameter.
                        For example, if `limit=10&offset=10`, the list returns ten items starting from the 11th item through the 20th.

                        If the value is greater than the number of items in the return list, no items are returned but no error occurs.<br>

                          The date can be specified in one of two formats.
                          * The standard iManage ISO 8601 format. This is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.µZ.
                          µ represents zero or more microseconds.
                          For example: 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229Z
                          * The standard iManage ISO 8601 format with offset. This is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.µ∓hh.mm.
                          µ represents zero or more microseconds.
                          For example: 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229+02.00.
                          The values at the end are an offset (to the nearest minute), moving the time ahead or behind.
                          This can be used to inline the time difference.
                          For example, India is five and half hours ahead of London, so a date from London can be set to 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229+05.30 to match Indian time.

    description: |
      Applications (also called apps) are software packages that either integrate with iManage Work to access data from it, or extend the functionality of iManage Work client applications.
      For example, a firm may use an application for document comparison.
      The application can extend iManage Work functionality by adding a context menu to documents for document comparison

      These applications are either developed by iManage, third-party vendors, or a company's internal development staff.

      Types of apps:
      * iManage apps - These applications are available for iManage Work client applications.
        For example, iManage Work Desktop for Windows, iManage Work Email Management for Gmail, iManage Work Desktop for Mac, and Mobility for iOS.

      * Third-party apps:
        * Standalone applications that interact with iManage Work through APIs only to access information and do not modify the iManage Work user interface, for example an application that tracks and analyzes audit records of documents in iManage Work to understand user behavior.
        * Applications that extend iManage features and modify the user interface by providing context menus or new panels in the the following applications:
          * iManage Work
          * iManage Work Desktop for Windows
          * iManage Control Center

      Not all apps are available to all users. Their access to apps are defined by their access level and tier support level.
      When users sign in into iManage Control Center, they can see only those applications on the home page on which they have the necessary privileges.

        This request is available for specific environments.<br>
        Prior to executing this request, check&nbsp;<a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/features">GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`</a>.<br>
        If `global_users` is `true`, this request is available in your environment.


        In addition to the roles' names, the status of each privilege within the role is listed.

        A global role is a set of privileges assigned to a user for managing iManage Work system operations,
        such as creating users, roles, and managing library encryption.

        Each role contains all the global privileges, and each global privilege is enabled or disabled.
        For example, a global role may be named *User Managers*, and the only role global privilege enabled is User Management.

        Any number of roles can be created for different set of priveleges in an organization.
        A user may be assigned with any number of roles. If a user belongs to more than one role,
        and there is a conflict among global privileges, the most permissive global privilege takes precedence.
        For example, if one role a user belongs to has the global privilege Settings Management enabled,
        and another role the user belongs to has the global privilege Settings Management disabled,
        the user will be treated as having the global privilege Settings Management enabled.

        Having any global privilege enabled does not make a user an iManage Work system administrator (tier 1, tier 2, or an NRTADMIN).
        That is, a user who is not a tier 1, tier 2, or an NRTADMIN can have global privileges enabled.
        However, many iManage Work system administrators will need to have global privileges enabled.
        For example, an NRTADMIN who manages users requires the global privilege User Management enabled.<br>

      summary: Get a settings collection
      description: |
        Returns a settings collection for either a specified application or for global settings.<br><br>
        This request returns a list of settings based on the specified app ID.
        Use either the app ID to return the settings associated with the specified application, or use the literal `global` to return global settings.<br>

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">App ID</font><br>
        Using the app ID (also called a client ID) returns the settings associated with the specified application.
        The application must have been previously registered, such as by an iManage Work system administrator.

        Applications are not required to have settings. In those cases, a successful request returns an empty data set.
        See the parameter `appID` below for additional details.
        For example, to return a list of settings for a specific application, use its app ID, or its client ID:<br>
        GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/settings/9ce3b82d-88h4-4255-b0ee-e516a239f4d1`<br>

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Global</font><br>
        Using the literal `global` returns a list of settings that are applicable across the iManage Work system and not to specific applications.
        Global settings indicate additional capabilities that may available to users.
        See the parameter `appID` below for additional details.<br>

        For example, to return a settings collection for the global settings:<br>
        GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/settings/global`<br>
        It returns:<br>
        ```json

        These values are stored in one of two ways: Settings collection (specified by its `type` being `value`), or a file (specified by its `type` being `file`).<br>

        The global-management level privilege required to execute this request: Settings Management.<br>
        That means, a user must be assigned to a global role with the Settings Management privilege enabled.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        The following request updates a settings value:<br>
        PUT `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/settings/global/im.email.filingFolder.defaultName`<br>
        Body:<br>
        ```
        {
          "type": "value",
          "value": false
        }
        ```
        It returns:<br>
        ```
        {
            "data": {
                "edit_date": "2019-02-27T16:52:37.55463Z",

                "value": false
            }
        }
        ```
        These values are stored in one of two ways: Settings collection (specified by its type being `value`), or a file (specified by its type being `file`).<br>

        The global-management privileges required to call this request: Role Management.<br>

        This means that a user must be assigned to a role that has the Role Management privilege.
        Each role contains all available role privileges. However, iManage system administrators either
        marks the privileges as `admin` (administrative access) or `no_access` (no access) for each role.
        It is possible to mark more than one privilege for a role as `admin`.

          * The `query` value is case insensitive.
          * The (&ast;) character is not supported for making wildcard searches. However, it is interpreted literally in the searches. For example, the ID *dhcidj(&ast;)fsu56df*
          * Partial matching is supported. For example, *All* matches with *All privileges*.

        This request is available for specific environments.<br>
        Prior to executing this request, check&nbsp;<a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/features">GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`</a>.<br>
        If `global_users` is `true`, this request is available in your environment.

        The global-management privileges required to call this request: Role Management.<br>

        **Important characteristics of this request:**
        * The request body is composed of two parameters: `include` and `exclude`.<br>
          Both of these parameters are required, even if they are empty.
        * The `include` parameter lists users who are to be added to the role.<br>
          The `exclude` parameter lists users who are to be removed from the role.
        * An empty `include` or `exclude` parameter indicates that there are no users to add or remove, respectively.
        * Each user is listed as an object under include or exclude parameter, and their `id` field must be specified.<br>
        * To add a user, the user ID must currently not be assigned to that global role.
        * If any of the user IDs conflicts with the one already assigned to a role, an error code is returned.
          However, the valid and non-conflicting user IDs are added.
        * To remove a user, the user ID must currently be assigned to that global role.
        * If a user ID does not exist, it is ignored and no error occurs.

      summary: Get workspaces with recent activity
      description: |
        Returns a list of workspaces that there has been any recent activity (within the last 30 days).<br><br>
        For a more a detailed recent workspace search, or to provide more parameters conveniently, see POST `/customers/{customerId}/recent-workspaces`.<br>

        ### Date Range Format

        Some parameters may specify a Date Range format. This is a search between two dates relative to the current date.<br>

        The format is:<br>
        `[begin]:[end][timescale].`<br>
        `begin` is the number of units (see timescale) to start calculating from.<br>
        `end` is the number of units (see timescale) to stop calculating to.<br>
        `timescale` is a time unit notation using `d` for days, `m` for months, `y` for years.<br>

        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can each be noted as positive or negative.
        Negative numbers indicate the time unit occurred in the past.
        The value `-30` days calculates 30 days before the current day.
        The more complete notation of `-30:-7d` indicates the beginning date is 30 days prior to the current date and the end date is seven days prior to the current date.
        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used mostly to compensate for time zone differences.
        For example, India is 11 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Chicago, so a Chicago-based search could use a thorough date range specified by `-30:1d`.<br>

        Incorrect notations, such as `-30:+1d` (using a plus sign), or `-30.5:1d` (noting a fraction), or if the end date is before the begin date result in an error.

          Specifies which facets to return.

          Facets are a summary list of the most common occurrences for each facet type listed.
          For example, if `facets` specifies custom1, all items containing any value for custom1 are counted.
          The five items with the highest counts are returned.
          Facets allow users to anticipate selections, or to present a list of suggestions that the user will likely select.

          Multiple facets can be included using a comma-separated list.
          For example: `facets=custom1,custom2,custom9`.
          If this parameter is omitted, which is the default value, no facets are returned.
          Possible values are: custom1, custom2, custom3, custom4, custom5, custom6, custom7, custom8, custom9, custom10, custom11, custom12, custom29, and custom30.

          This parameter is often used along with the `results` parameter.
          If neither of the parameters are included, only the search results are returned.
          If `results=false`, and a facets value is specified, only the facets information is returned.
          If both the parameters are specified, both facets and search results are returned.
          If `results=false` and no valid facets parameters are specified, no data of either type is returned. However, an empty response object is returned.<br>

          <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request</font><br>
          In this example, the search is GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/recent-workspaces?results=false&facets=custom1,custom9`.
          The response JSON object does not include any search results.
          The facets section specified returning custom9 but there are no custom9 values to return.
          However, three custom1 values are returned, with *Microsoft* being the most common with 132 instances.

            To match partial fields, include the wildcard character (&ast;) before, after, or at both ends of the term.<br>

                    iManage Work returns date values in UTC. Timezone offset can be used to translate UTC to the local time for display in the client application.
                    The value may be positive (minutes ahead of UTC) or negative (minutes behind UTC).
                    For example, India is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC, which is 330 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=330`.

                    Specifies fields to return in the response JSON.<br><br>
                    Some searches could return many fields, and not all are of interest for the search.
                    Therefore, this request specifies the fields to return.
                    By default, only the `id` and `wstype` fields are included.<br><br>
                    If more fields are needed to be returned, use the parameter `profile_fields` to specify those.
                    The parameter `profile_fields` is not required. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.
                    Items found during the search are still returned even if the search field specifying them is not included in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, the search can specify `owner=acase` but it does not have to include `owner` in the `profile_fields`.<br><br>

                    To return additional fields, specify both the object type and the fields in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, for the following request body specifies returning the `name` and `owner` fields.
                    This is in addition to the two default `id` and `wstype` fields.
                    ```
                    {
                      "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
                      "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "name", "owner"] }
                    }
                    ```
                    The parameter `profile_fields` can contain multiple entries, one for each of the following object types.<br><br>

                    |Type|Description|
                    |:---|:---|
                    |document|A document object.|
                    |email|A document object.|
                    |folder|A folder object.|
                    |workspace|A workspace object.|
                    |user|A user object.|

                    For each object type, specify additional fields.
                    If an object type is included but no objects of that type are returned, that object type entry is ignored.<br>

                    Multiple object types can also be included. The following example specifies the return fields for workspace and email:
                    ```
                    {
                      "profile_fields":
                      {
                        "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ],
                        "email": [ "sender", "title" ]
                      }
                    }
                    ```

                    The parameter `profile_fields` is often combined with the parameter `filters`, which defines the search criteria.
                    The following example returns workspaces that meet the `filters` criteria, and returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response:
                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields":
                        {
                          "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ]
                        },

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                    If a `filters` parameter is not included, all items are returned.
                    If a `filters` parameter is included, returns only items matching all the filters.
                    For example, the following returns only items with a custom1 alias of *Enron* and has the name of *Acquisitions*.<br><br>

                    ```
                      {

                      }
                    ```

                    The parameter `filters` is often combined with the parameter `profile_fields`, which returns specified fields in the response object.
                    The following example returns documents that meet the `filters` requirements.
                    If this is a workspace object, it also returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response.

                    ```

          The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
          The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
          For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

          The format is:<br>
          `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

          | Notation | Description |
          |:--- |:---|
          | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
          | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
          | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
          | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

          The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
          Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

          The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
           * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
           * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
           * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

          | Notation | Description |
          |:---:|:---|
          | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |

          | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
          | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
          | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
          | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

          The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
          Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

          The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
           * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
           * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
           * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

          Examples:

          | Notation | Description |
          |:---:|:---|
          | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
          | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
          | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

          iManage Work returns date values in UTC. Timezone offset can be used to translate UTC to the local time for display in the client application.
          The value may be positive (minutes ahead of UTC) or negative (minutes behind UTC).
          For example, India is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC, which is 330 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=330`.
          Houston is six hours behind UTC, which is -360 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=-360`.

                    Specifies fields to return in the response JSON.<br><br>
                    Some searches could return many fields, and not all are of interest for the search.
                    Therefore, this request specifies the fields to return.
                    By default, only the `id` and `wstype` fields are included.<br><br>
                    If more fields are needed to be returned, use the parameter `profile_fields` to specify those.
                    The parameter `profile_fields` is not required. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.
                    Items found during the search are still returned even if the search field specifying them is not included in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, the search can specify `owner=acase` but it does not have to include `owner` in the `profile_fields`.<br><br>

                    To return additional fields, specify both the object type and the fields in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, for the following request body specifies returning the `name` and `owner` fields.
                    This is in addition to the two default `id` and `wstype` fields.
                    ```
                    {
                      "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
                      "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "name", "owner"] }
                    }
                    ```
                    The parameter `profile_fields` can contain multiple entries, one for each of the following object types.<br><br>

                    |Type|Description|
                    |:---|:---|
                    |document|A document object.|
                    |email|A document object.|
                    |folder|A folder object.|
                    |workspace|A workspace object.|
                    |user|A user object.|

                    For each object type, specify additional fields.
                    If an object type is included but no objects of that type are returned, that object type entry is ignored.<br>

                    Multiple object types can also be included. The following example specifies the return fields for workspace and email:
                    ```
                    {
                      "profile_fields":
                      {
                        "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ],
                        "email": [ "sender", "title" ]
                      }
                    }
                    ```

                    The parameter `profile_fields` is often combined with the parameter `filters`, which defines the search criteria.
                    The following example returns workspaces that meet the `filters` criteria, and returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response:
                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields":
                        {
                          "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ]
                        },
                        "filters":
                        {

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |

                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
                        | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
                        | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

The two parameters of `edit_date_from` and `edit_date_to` can be used in combination to form a range. For example, **edit_date_from=2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00&edit_date_to=2018-04-23T18:49:23Z** would return documents edited on or after 2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00 but before 2018-04-23T18:49:23Z. If one parameter is omitted, the search would assume the current date for the other, if appropriate.

                        Each iManage Work system has a customizable list of document types per the organizational requirements.
                        For example, *Word*, *WordX*, *Acrobat*, *Powerpoint*. <br>
                        These values are not necessarily the same as the document type's extension field, which may be *doc*, *docx*, *pdf*, or *ppt*.<br>
                        Document type is not case sensitive, that is, *Word* matches with *word*.<br>
                        There is no stemming and the wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.
                        For example, *acrob* or *acrob&#42;* does not match *acrobat*.<br>
                        Multiple document types can be included using a comma-separated list.
                        For example, *type=WORD,WORDX,WORDXT*

                        <br>

                      description: |-
                        Indicates the document number of a document.

                        Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
                        and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
                        Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>
                        For example, if library ID is ACTIVE_UK, document number is 72634, and document version is 3, then document ID is `ACTIVE_UK!72634.3`.
                      example: 3562
                    document_version:
                      type: integer
                      description: |-
                        Specifies the document version number.<br><br>
                        The document version number is the number of times a document has been edited.
                        For example, if the document ID is `active!72634.3`, the document version number is 3.<br><br>

                        When specifying document version numbers, either a single value can be included (`document_number=1`), or
                        a comma-separated list may be used to specify multiple document version numbers (`document_number=1,3`).
                      example: 1

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |

                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                    Specifies the filters, or the search criteria.<br><br>
                    If a `filters` parameter is not included, all items are returned.
                    If a `filters` parameter is included, returns only items matching all the filters.
                    For example, the following returns only items with a custom1 alias of *Enron* and has the name of *Acquisitions*.<br><br>

                    ```
                      {
                        "filters" :
                        {
                          "custom1" : "Enron",
                          "name"    : "Acquisitions"

                      }
                    ```

                    The parameter `filters` is often combined with the parameter `profile_fields`, which returns specified fields in the response object.
                    The following example returns documents that meet the `filters` requirements.
                    If this is a workspace object, it also returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response.

                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields" :

          Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>

          This parameter is often used along with the `facets` parameter.
          If neither of the parameters are included, only search results are returned.
          If `results=false`, and a facets value is specified, only the facets information is returned.
          If both the parameters are specified, both facets and search results are returned.
          If `results=false` and no valid facets parameters are specified, then no data of either kind are returned.

          iManage Work returns date values in UTC. Timezone offset can be used to translate UTC to the local time for display in the client application.
          The value may be positive (minutes ahead of UTC) or negative (minutes behind UTC).
          For example, India is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC, which is 330 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=330`.

          Each iManage Work system has a customizable list of document types per the organizational requirements.
          For example, *Word*, *WordX*, *Acrobat*, *Powerpoint*. <br>
          These values are not necessarily the same as the document type's extension field, which may be *doc*, *docx*, *pdf*, or *ppt*.<br>
          Document type is not case sensitive, that is, *Word* matches with *word*.<br>
          There is no stemming and the wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.
          For example, *acrob* or *acrob&#42;* does not match *acrobat*.<br>
          Multiple document types can be included using a comma-separated list.
          For example, *type=WORD,WORDX,WORDXT*

                    Specifies fields to return in the response JSON.<br><br>
                    Some searches could return many fields, and not all are of interest for the search.
                    Therefore, this request specifies the fields to return.
                    By default, only the `id` and `wstype` fields are included.<br><br>
                    If more fields are needed to be returned, use the parameter `profile_fields` to specify those.
                    The parameter `profile_fields` is not required. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.
                    Items found during the search are still returned even if the search field specifying them is not included in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, the search can specify `owner=acase` but it does not have to include `owner` in the `profile_fields`.<br><br>

                    To return additional fields, specify both the object type and the fields in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, for the following request body specifies returning the `name` and `owner` fields.
                    This is in addition to the two default `id` and `wstype` fields.
                    ```
                    {
                      "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
                      "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "name", "owner"] }
                    }
                    ```
                    The parameter `profile_fields` can contain multiple entries, one for each of the following object types.<br><br>

                    |Type|Description|
                    |:---|:---|
                    |document|A document object.|
                    |email|A document object.|
                    |folder|A folder object.|
                    |workspace|A workspace object.|
                    |user|A user object.|

                    For each object type, specify additional fields.
                    If an object type is included but no objects of that type are returned, that object type entry is ignored.<br>

                    Multiple object types can also be included. The following example specifies the return fields for workspace and email:
                    ```
                    {
                      "profile_fields":
                      {
                        "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ],
                        "email": [ "sender", "title" ]
                      }
                    }
                    ```

                    The parameter `profile_fields` is often combined with the parameter `filters`, which defines the search criteria.
                    The following example returns workspaces that meet the `filters` criteria, and returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response:
                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields":
                        {
                          "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ]
                        },
                        "filters":
                        {
                          "custom1": "Enron",

                        }
                    }

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:---:|:---|
                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
                        | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
                        | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

                        The two parameters of `edit_date_from` and `edit_date_to` can be used in combination to form a range. For example, **edit_date_from=2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00&edit_date_to=2018-04-23T18:49:23Z** would return documents edited on or after 2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00 but before 2018-04-23T18:49:23Z. If one parameter is omitted, the search would assume the current date for the other, if appropriate.

                        Each iManage Work system has a customizable list of document types per the organizational requirements.
                        For example, *Word*, *WordX*, *Acrobat*, *Powerpoint*. <br>
                        These values are not necessarily the same as the document type's extension field, which may be *doc*, *docx*, *pdf*, or *ppt*.<br>
                        Document type is not case sensitive, that is, *Word* matches with *word*.<br>
                        There is no stemming and the wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.
                        For example, *acrob* or *acrob&#42;* does not match *acrobat*.<br>
                        Multiple document types can be included using a comma-separated list.
                        For example, *type=WORD,WORDX,WORDXT*

                        Indicates the document number of a document.

                        Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
                        and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
                        Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>
                        For example, if library ID is ACTIVE_UK, document number is 72634, and document version is 3, then document ID is `ACTIVE_UK!72634.3`.
                      example: 123 "123" "123,124"
                    document_version:

                        Indicates the document version number.<br><br>
                        The document version number is the number of times a document has been edited.
                        For example, if the document ID is `active!72634.3`, the document version number is 3.<br><br>

                        When specifying document version numbers, either a single value can be included (`document_number=1`), or
                        a comma-separated list may be used to specify multiple document version numbers (`document_number=1,3`).
                      example: 1 "1" "1,2"

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:---:|:---|
                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
                        | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
                        | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

                    If a `filters` parameter is not included, all items are returned.
                    If a `filters` parameter is included, returns only items matching all the filters.
                    For example, the following returns only items with a custom1 alias of *Enron* and has the name of *Acquisitions*.<br><br>

                    ```
                      {
                        "filters" :
                        {
                          "custom1" : "Enron",
                          "name"    : "Acquisitions"

                      }
                    ```

                    The parameter `filters` is often combined with the parameter `profile_fields`, which returns specified fields in the response object.
                    The following example returns documents that meet the `filters` requirements.
                    If this is a workspace object, it also returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response.

                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields" :

      - name: facets

        description: |
          Specifies which facets to return.

          Facets are a summary list of the most common occurrences for each facet type listed.
          For example, if `facets` specifies custom1, all items containing any value for custom1 are counted.
          The five items with the highest counts are returned.
          Facets allow users to anticipate selections, or to present a list of suggestions that the user will likely select.

          Multiple facets can be included using a comma-separated list.
          For example: `facets=custom1,custom2,custom9`.
          If this parameter is omitted, which is the default value, no facets are returned.
          Possible values are: custom1, custom2, custom3, custom4, custom5, custom6, custom7, custom8, custom9, custom10, custom11, custom12, custom29, and custom30.

          This parameter is often used along with the `results` parameter.
          If neither of the parameters are included, only the search results are returned.
          If `results=false`, and a facets value is specified, only the facets information is returned.
          If both the parameters are specified, both facets and search results are returned.
          If `results=false` and no valid facets parameters are specified, no data of either type is returned. However, an empty response object is returned.<br>

          <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request</font><br>
          In this example, the search is GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/recent-workspaces?results=false&facets=custom1,custom9`.
          The response JSON object does not include any search results.
          The facets section specified returning custom9 but there are no custom9 values to return.
          However, three custom1 values are returned, with *Microsoft* being the most common with 132 instances.

          The cursor is a value that specifies an item by an ID within the results set to start returning from.

          For a subsequent search, set `cursor` to the cursor value returned in the previous search.
          Do not modify the cursor value in anyway.
          The standard_cursor mode is the preferred paging mode, as it is quicker and less stressful on system performance.
          The parameter `offset` is ignored in this mode.<br>

          * standard -  Specifies the query parameter `offset` can be used to identify the first item to return.
          The offset is a value that specifies the position of an item within the results set to start returning from.
          This is relative to zero, or the absolute start of the list.
          An offset value of zero starts at the beginning of the results set.
          An offset value of 5, starts with the fifth item in the results set.

      summary: Create a workspace
      description: |
        Creates a workspace.<br>

        <font style="color:black;size:5">Relationship with workspace templates</font><br>
        Creating a workspace is associated with workspace templates.
        A workspace template is a predefined workspace whose structure is copied for the new workspace.
        These define the:<br>
        * The number, types, and structure of containers
        * Whether users can rename containers
        * Where users can create additional containers within that workspace.
        These restrictions allow the organization to better structure, standardize, and control the format of their workspaces.<br>

        Workspace template restrictions are automatically enforced when creating workspaces through iManage Work clients.
        This means users attempting to add containers through iManage Work clients may have template restrictions.
        For more information, see `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/templates`.<br>

        Workspace template restrictions are not enforced when using REST requests directly.
        Workspaces can be created directly by using a series of requests, first to create the workspace, and then to populate it with containers.
        That means when creating a workspace using REST requests, a workspace template should be explicitly assigned by adding a name-value pair with the format `"TemplateId": "workspaceId"`.<br>

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        The only two required fields are `name` and `default security`.<br>
        The following request creates a workspace in library active_uk:<br>
        POST `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/workspaces`<br>
        The request body:<br>

        ```
        {
          "name": "Retained documents",
          "default_security" : "private"
        }
        ```

        <br>The following request creates a name-value pair for a workspace:<br>
        PATCH `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/workspaces/active_us!179273/name-value-pairs`<br>
        The request body:<br>

        ```
        {
          "TemplateId": "active_us!179193"
        }
        ```

        To update a workspace, see PATCH `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}`<br>
        To delete a workspace, see DELETE `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceID}`
        For an overview of workspace templates, see the topic introduction of `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/templates`
        To return a list of templates in a library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/templates`
        To return a list of children (containers and documents) from the top level of a workspace, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/children`
        To return a list of children (containers and documents) from a specified folder, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/folders/{folderId}/children`
        To return a list of workspaces from a library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces`

        Returns workspaces based on the specified criteria.<br>

        There are three considerations when making this call.<br><br>
        First, all query parameters must be specified in the request body, and that these parameters must not be search criteria.
        As an example, the request body of the POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryName}/workspaces/search` specifies one parameter:

        ```
        {
          "limit" : 1000
        }
        ```

        <br>Second, all search related query parameters must be in the `filters` parameter.
        As an example, the request body of the POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryName}/workspaces/search` specifies
        one search parameter (that finds workspaces edited within the last 30 days):

        ```
        {
          "filters":
          {
            "edit_date": "-30:0d"
          }
        }
        ```

        Second, all query parameters must be specified in the request body.
        As an example, the request body of POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryName}/workspaces/search` specifies one parameter:

        ```
        {
          "limit" : 1000
        }
        ```
        The combined version:
            ```
            {
              "limit" : 1000,
              "filters":
              {
                "edit_date": "-30:0d"
              }
            }
            ```

        <br>Third, the response JSON object includes profile properties only if those are explicitly included to be returned.
        The exception is that the two profile properties `id`, and `wstype` are always returned and cannot be omitted from being returned.
        As an example, the request body of the POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryName}/workspaces/search` with the default `profile_fields` parameters,
        and an empty request body (`{}`) returns the default properties:

        ```
        {
            "data":
            [
              {
                "id": "active!1268670",
                "wstype": "workspace"
              },
              {
                "id": "active!1268669",
                "wstype": "workspace"
              }
            ],
            "overflow": true
          }
          ```
          The same POST request `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryName}/workspaces/search` with the following profile_fields parameters in the body:

          ```json
          {
            "profile_fields" :
            {
              "workspace"  :
              [
                "create_date",
                "edit_date"
              ]
            }
          }```

          now returns:
          ```json
          {
              "data": [
                  {
                      "id": "active!1273729",
                      "create_date": "2019-10-29T11:44:24.229Z",
                      "edit_date": "2019-10-29T11:44:24.229Z",
                      "wstype": "workspace"
                  },
                  {
                      "id": "active!1273639",
                      "create_date": "2019-10-29T11:36:56.03Z",
                      "edit_date": "2019-10-29T11:36:56.03Z",
                      "wstype": "workspace"
                  }
              ],
              "overflow": true
          }
          ```

          These can be combined into a single request body:

          ```
          {
          	"filters":
          	{
          		"edit_date": "-30:0d"
          	},
          	"profile_fields" :
          	{
              "workspace"  :
              [
                "create_date",
                "edit_date"
              ]
            }
          }
          ```

                          Indicates the effective security access level available to the user.

                          Effective security is the access level that is the net result of a combination of the following:
                          * an objects's default security
                          * a user's access permission for that object
                          * possible conflicts among groups to which the user belongs to
                          * the security model being used.

                          The available access levels are:

                          |Access level|Description|

                          |read_write|The user can access the container, or read and edit a document unless explicitly excluded.|
                          |full_access|The user has complete access to the container or document, and may read, edit, or delete the item. The user may grant permissions to other users and groups, and can edit the item's default security levels.|

        Deletes the specified workspace.<br><br>
        A successfully deleted workspace will return no response object.
        A delete request may fail for two common conditions:<br>

        1. The workspace must not contain any child.<br>
        For example, a workspace cannot have any folders or documents under it.
        Check for the workspace children using the request:<br>
        GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/children`.

        2. You must have read/write access permission to that item and to all other attached items.<br>
        This applies to all create, delete, and modify operations.
        Check access permission for each library using the request:<br>
        GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/operations`.<br>

        The minimum access permission required on the library to implement this request: NRTADMIN.

        Fields that cannot be directly updated, such as `database` and `wstype`, are ignored if included in the request body.
        Fields containing incorrect values fail the entire request, and no update, even a partial update, occurs.<br>

        Request body: See the **Request samples** section of the sample provided in the right pane.

        Although the parameters `custom2_description`, `edit_date`, and `has_subfolders` are specified in the request body in the example,
        they cannot be updated using this request and it does not cause an error.

    description: |
      Tabs are containers that exist only at the root level of a workspace.
      They are intended to provide additional or more precise organization.
      Tabs can hold other folders but not other tabs.
      Tabs cannot contain documents directly under them, although folders inside a tab can contain documents.<br>

      A tab is a container and its tab ID is a combination of its library name and a number.
      For example: active!654235.

        Updates the default security of the workspace, and users and groups access to the workspace.<br>

        The request body can contain up to three fields:<br>
        * `default_security`. This sets the new default security for the specified workspace.<br>
        The following request body sets the default security to public:<br>
        ```
        {
          "default_security": "public"
        }
        ```

        * `include`. This array contains a list of users or groups who are added to those who can access the workspace.
        Including a user or group who already has access updates them to the new values.<br>
        The following request body adds access to user ACASE to the workspace:<br>
        ```
        {
          "include" :

              "type" : "user"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        * `remove`. This array contains a list of users or groups who are to be removed from those who can access the workspace.
        Users or groups who does not have access are ignored.<br>
        The following request body removes access to user ACASE from the workspace:<br>
        ```

    description: |
      Name-value pairs are customized properties for a workspace to store additional information.<br>

      Name-value pairs allow the open-ended storage of any additional information with the workspace.
      These are in addition to the system-provided properties, and are saved separately from them.
      They are not custom fields, not a part of the object model, or a part of the object profile.
      The information is stored as a dictionary pair in the format `"key_name": "value"`.
      Any number of pairs can be stored.<br>

      Name-value pairs are allowed with the following object types:
      * Documents
      * Folders and tabs
      * Workspaces

      For example, the workspace owner may need to store a trial or court date.
      As there is no property for this, a name-value pair can be created as `"trial_date": "2021-01-15T15:00:00.000000Z"`.<br>

      <font style="color:black;size:5">Using name-value-pairs requests</font><br><br>
      To return the name-value pairs properties of a workspace, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/name-value-pairs`<br><br>
      The following request returns all the name-value pairs of the specified workspace:<br>
      GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/workspaces/active_us!123/name-value-pairs`<br>
      Response body:<br>
       ```
      {
         "trial_date": "2021-01-15T15:00:00.000000Z",
         "prefix_document_name": "true"
      }
      ```

      <br>To create a new name-value pair, to modify the value of an existing one, or to delete a pair, use PATCH `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/name-value-pairs`<br><br>
      This example continues the one above.
      * The first entry creates a new name-value pair `project_lead` with `ACASE` as the value.
      * The second entry modifies the existing `trial_date` to `2021-02-15T15:00:00.000000Z`.
      * The third entry deletes `prefix_document_name` by setting it to null.
      * The fourth entry attempts to delete a name-value pair that does not exist.
      No error occurs if deleting a name-value pair that is not already present.

      summary: Create a library user
      description: |
        Creates a new user profile in the specified library.<br>

        The following types of users can be created in iManage Work:
         * **Virtual users** - The users are created and managed in iManage Work. The virtual users are authenticated against passwords stored in iManage Work. They are not part of the organization's directory service.
             These are typically external users who are not part of the organization and are included for a specific purpose and for a defined period of time. For example, auditors, interns, and contractors.
             This user is created at the global level, and must be manually assigned to a library. A virtual user can be converted to an enterprise user by changing their user type (`nos`) value from 2 to 6.
         * **Enterprise users** - The users that are added to iManage Work from the organization's directory service. The enterprise users are authenticated against the IDP configured
             by an organization. Virtual users can be synced with the organization's directory service and converted to enterprise users by changing their user type (`nos`) value from 6 to 2.

        Adds the specified workspace to the recent workspaces list of the user.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Required authorization</font><br>
        The user executing this request must either be an NRTADMIN or have full access on the workspace to be able to
        add it to another user's Recent Workspaces list.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Important to know</font><br>
        After a workspace has been added to a user's Recent Workspaces list, the user can sign in and retrieve the
        newly updated list by executing the request <a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/libraries/-libraryId-/recent-workspaces">GET /customers/{customerId}/recent-workspaces</a>.

        **Note**: When the user is retrieving recent workspaces, they must specify the type of activity that was
        used while adding the recent workspace. This can be done by using the `activity` query parameter.

        For example: <br>
        GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/{{customerId}}/recent-workspaces?activity=browse`

      description: |
        Creates or updates workspace shortcuts and categories, and updates the security profile of categories, in the specified user's My Matters.
        It also adds subscriptions on other users' My Matters for the target user (specified in the endpoint as `userId`).

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Required authorization</font><br>
        The minimum access level required to execute this request: NRTADMIN. <br>
        That means, to execute this request a user must be a member of the NRTADMIN group of the library.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Feature availability </font><br>
        This request is available only for specific environments.<br>
        Prior to executing this request, execute GET `/customers/{customerId}/features` to check the value of `my_matters_admin_import` field.<br>
        If `my_matters_admin_import` is `true`, this request is available.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Important to know</font><br>
        * If `parent_id` is not provided, the request applies changes to My Matters of the target user.
        * If `parent_id` is provided, the request applies only to the category identified by this ID.
          This ID must point to an existing category within My Matters of the target user.
        * The request body parameters `subscriptions` and `security` can be applied only at the root level of My Matters and not to any categories.
          This is because subscriptions can be added and security can be applied only at the root level of My Matters.
          Therefore, the request returns a warning if `subscriptions` and `security` are specified along with the `parent_id` of a category.
        * The `shortcut_id` can be specified to update an existing shortcut.
        * More than one shortcut to the same workspace can be created in My Matters.
        * A user must give access to their My Matters to another user before that user can subscribe to it. For more information, see the <a href="#tag--My-Matters">My Matters</a> collection.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        This sample request performs the following:
        * creates a new category *Litigation*
        * updates the name of the category ACTIVE_UK!24499 to *Legal Actions*
        * adds a shortcut to the workspace ACTIVE_UK!21827 in the category ACTIVE_UK!2449938 identified by the `parent_id`.

        As the `parent_id` of a category is specified in this request, specifying the `security` and `subscriptions` parameters would return a warning.

        ```

        Returns a list of possible My Matters subscriptions from other users.<br><br>
        A subscription is a shortcut to another user's My Matters. It is created only by the My Matters'owner.
        Subscription allows a user to share their My Matters with others.<br>

        The host user is the user offering their My Matters to others. They create the subscription.
        The invited user is the user being offered the subscription to the host user's My Matters.
        Acceptance of the subscription is automatic; no additional action is required on their part.
        The invited user is still limited by default security and access permission.
        The subscription remains in place until it is explicitly deleted by the host user.<br>

        This list returns both current subscriptions and possible subscriptions.<br><br>
        * A current subscription is a My Matters subscription that has been created for the specified user.
        The offering is made by the host user. The subscription acceptance is automatic.
        The invited user does not have to explicitly accept.<br>
        * A possible subscription is a subscription that could be offered by another user.
        That is, each user has their own My Matters, and each of these My Matters can be offered to other users.
        Each offering is a possible subscription.
        This request lists all other users' My Matters that the specified user does not have a subscription to yet.
        Since this includes all users on their iManage Work system, this list could be significantly long.<br>

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        The following request returns a list of all possible and current subscriptions for user ACASE.<br>
        GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/users/acase/my-matters/available-subscriptions`

      summary: Get My Matters subscriptions
      description: |
        Returns a list of subscriptions of the specified user to another user's My Matters.<br><br>
        A subscription is a shortcut to another user's My Matters. It is created only by the My Matters'owner.
        Subscription allows a user to share their My Matters with others.<br>

        The host user is the user offering their My Matters to others. They create the subscription.
        The invited user is the user being offered the subscription to the host user's My Matters.
        Acceptance of the subscription is automatic; no additional action is required on their part.
        The invited user is still limited by default security and access permission.
        The subscription remains in place until it is explicitly deleted by the host user.<br>

      My Matters contains shortcuts to workspaces that are selected by the user.

      Users can save shortcuts to those workspaces.

      My Matters workspaces are explicitly bookmarked by the user.

      description: |
        Gets all the file types that match the specified search criteria.<br><br>
        If the search criteria is omitted, it returns all available file types.<br><br>
        Documents or files may be opened in specific applications so that they can be read or edited.
        Many of the common types of files come preconfigured during installation.
        It is likely that no further system modifications are required.
        However, organizations may have their own custom types of files, or may want to have a different application to open them.
        The process of associating a document or file type to an application that can read it uses two iManage resources: File type, and file handler.<br>

        **File type**
        A File type matches a document or file application extension to an application type.
        The application extension is the last part of a file name, such as .doc for Microsoft Word document, or .pdf for an Adobe Acrobat document.
        Every document or file is requires a file type.
        That means .doc, docx, .docm, and .dot, as examples, each will have a file type.
        The file type resource also associates a file extension with a file handler type.<br>

        **File handler**
        A file handler associates a file handler type with an application.
        Every application used to open a document or file requires a file handler resource.
        One application may be used to open one or more file types.
        For example, the file types .doc, docx, .docm, and .dot can all be opened by a single application, Microsoft Word.<br>

        The following request illustrates this.
        The two resources, the file type and the file handler, are listed below.

        * The two significant fields for the file type are `app_extension`, and the `id`. The `app_extension` associates the value DOC with the file handler `id` of WORD.

        * The two significant fields for the file handler are the `id` and `location`. The `id` associates the application type with the `location` of the application.

        **File type resource**
        Two file types are shown, and both associate `app_extension`, which are DOC and DOCM, to the file handler WORD.<br>
        The sample request GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/active/types?app_extension=doc*` returns a list like:

        ```
        {
          "data": [
            {
                "app_extension": "DOC",
                "auto_detect": true,
                "database": "active",
                "description": "Microsoft Word document",
                "dms_extension": "%V",
                "hipaa": false,
                "id": "WORD",
                "indexable": true,
                "ssid": 9932985782931
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        **File handler resource**
        The single file handler shown below associates `id`, which is WORD, to the location of the application.<br>
        The sample request GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/active/appsetup/word` returns a list like:

        ```
        {
          "data": [
            {
              "id": "WORD",
              "location": "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office\\WINWORD.EXE",
              "database": "active",
              "dde": true,
              "dde_app_name": "WINWORD",
              "dde_open": "[REM _DDE_Direct][FileOpen(\"??\")]",
              "dde_print": "[FileOpen.Name=\"??\"][FilePrint 0][DocClose 2]",
              "dde_print_1": "[FileOpen.Name=\"??\"][FilePrint 0][FileExit 2]",
              "dde_read_open": "[FileOpen.Name=\"??\",.ReadOnly = 1]",
              "dde_topic": "SYSTEM",
              "integration_mode": "N",
              "name": "Microsoft Word",
              "primary": true
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        <br>
        The diagram below illustrates the file type-file handler relationship.
        The file type resource is on the left.
        The file handler resource is on the right.<br>
        Step 1 ties the `app_extension` of DOC to the `id` of WORD.<br>
        Step 2 ties the file type's `id` of WORD to the file handler's `id` of WORD.
        Those two IDs must match.<br>
        Step 3 allows the file handler in turn to tie the `id` to a `location` of an executable that will open documents or files of the `app_extension` type.<br>

          Specifies a string to search for users or groups.

          ### Searching for users
          The user search is performed against the user fields `id`, `email`, and `fullname`.
          The value provided can contain multiple search terms, separated either by commas or spaces.
          A match is found if any of these user fields contain all the search terms in any order.

          The following example outlines some of the behaviours of the query parameter when attempting to search for a user:<br>

          **Sample user profile**
          - `id`: ACASE
          - `email`: acase@ajubalaw.com
          - `fullname`: Andrew Case

          | Query value | Result | Reason |
          | - | - | - |
          | case andrew | Match is found. | The `fullname` contains all search terms. |
          | drew case | Match is found. | The `fullname` contains all search terms. |
          | ajubalaw com acase | Match is found. | The `email` contains all search terms.|
          | case ajuba | Match is found. | The `email` contains all search terms.|
          | CASE | Match is found.| The `id`, `fullname`, and `email` contain the search term.|
          | ajubalaw andrew | No match is found. | Both `fullname` and `email` contain only one of the search terms.|

          ### Searching for groups
          The group search is performed against the group fields `id` and `fullname`.
          The multiple search strings provided are treated as a single contiguous search term.
          A match is found only if these group fields contain the search term in its entirety.

          The following example outlines some of the behaviours of the query parameter when attempting to search for a group:<br>

          **Sample group profile**
          - `id`: CONT_PARALEGAL
          - `fullname`: Paralegal Contractors

          | Query value | Result | Reason |
          | - | - | - |
          | cont | Match is found. | The `id` and `fullname` both contain the search term. |
          | cont_para | Match is found. | The `id` contains the search term. |
          | paralegal contractors | Match is found. | The `fullname` contains the search term. |
          | contractors paralegal | No match is found. | None of the group fields contain the search term. |

          Filters documents by create date, based on the specified date range.<br>
          The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
          The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
          For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

          The format is:<br>
          `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

          | Notation | Description |
          |:--- |:---|
          | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
          | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
          | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
          | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

          The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
          Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

          The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
           * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
           * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
           * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

          | Notation | Description |
          |:---:|:---|
          | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
          | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
          | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

          Specifies the offset in whole minutes from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).<br><br>
          iManage Work returns date values in UTC. Timezone offset can be used to translate UTC to the local time for display in the client application.
          The value may be positive (minutes ahead of UTC) or negative (minutes behind UTC).
          For example, India is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC, which is 330 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=330`.
          Houston is six hours behind UTC, which is -360 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=-360`.

      summary: Create a workspace template
      description: |
        Creates a workspace template.

        The minimum access permission required on the library to implement this request: NRTADMIN.

        This request creates only the workspace template.
        It does not:
        * Create containers within the workspace template. Those must be added in separate step, noted in the **Containers** section.
        * Create a workspace.

        Custom properties, such as custom1 or custom8, can have aliases defined for a workspace template.
        That means, when a workspace is created from this workspace template, aliases for these custom properties are automatically applied to the workspace.
        Custom properties custom1 through custom16, custom29 and custom30 are validated fields.
        Aliases provided for the workspace template must be defined when the workspace template is created.
        If the alias is not defined, the request results in an error ("Document profile is invalid").

        To complete the workspace template, three additional types of requests can be added: Containers, containers requirement, and name prefixes or suffixes.

        **Containers**<br>
        Each container (a folder, tab, or search folder) must be added with a separate request.
        A workspace template can be created without any containers.
        Even if flexible folders enabled, users can add containers, subject to their other security and permissions limits.
        Use the template's `id` as the `workspaceId` when creating containers at the root level of the workspace using the following requests.
        The containers can be created at the root level of the workspace template with these requests:
        * To create a folder, see POST `/customers/customerId/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/folders`
        * To create a tab, see POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/tabs`
        * To create a search folder, see POST `/customers/customerId/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/folders`

        If subfolders are created after that, use the parent's container ID as normal for the parent of each subfolder.

        **Containers requirement**<br>
        Containers specified in workspace templates are created in the workspace in one of the following ways:
        * Workspace Creation. The container is created automatically at the time the workspace is created.
        * Optional. The container may be created at the time the workspace is created, or it may be created later.
        * Required. The container is created automatically at the time its parent container is created.
        A required container at the rool level of workspace is considerd to be a Workspace Creation container.
        Required is the default value.

        To add the container creation requirements of Workspace Creation or Optional, iManage recommends using iManage Control Center.
        See <a href="https://docs.imanage.com/cc-help/10.3.1/en/Creating_a_folder_structure.html" target="_blank">Creating a folder structure</a>.

        **Name prefixes or suffixes**
        To add workspace and container name prefixes or suffixes, iManage recommends using iManage Control Center.
        See <a href="https://docs.imanage.com/cc-help/10.3.1/en/Name_Prefixes_and_Suffixes.html" target="_blank">Name prefixes and suffixes</a>.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        The following request creates a workspace template:<br>
        POST `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/templates`<br>
        Request body: See the **Request samples** section of the sample provided in the right pane.

        This request adds a folder at the root level of the workspace template.
        Assume that the templateID returned from the previous request was active_us!17437. Use that value for the workspaceID of this request.
        POST `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/workspaces/active_us!17437/folders`<br>

        Updates the specified template.<br><br>

         The minimum access permission required on the library to implement this request: NRTADMIN.

        This request updates only the basic workspace template.
        The containers referenced within the template must be updated individually.

        Custom properties, such as custom1 or custom8, can have aliases added to the workspace template.
        That means, when a workspace is created from this workspace template, aliases for these custom properties are automatically applied to the workspace.
        Custom properties custom1 through custom16, custom29 and custom30 are validated fields.
        Aliases provided for the workspace template must be defined when the workspace template is created.
        If the alias is not defined, the request results in an error ("Document profile is invalid").

        Gets the profile of the specified tab.<br>

        Tabs can only exist at the root level of a workspace.
        They are intended to provide more precise organization of folders.
        Tabs can hold folders but not other tabs.
        Documents cannot be placed directly to a tab, although folders inside a tab can contain documents.
        In contrast, folders can hold documents but not tabs.<br>

                        Indicates the document number of a document.

                        Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
                        and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
                        Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>
                        For example, if library ID is ACTIVE_UK, document number is 72634, and document version is 3, then document ID is `ACTIVE_UK!72634.3`.

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:---:|:---|
                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
                        | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
                        | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:---:|:---|
                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |

                        When searching, this parameter specifies the latest value to search to.
                        For example, specifying `2018-05-24T00:00:00-08:00` (Saturday May 24, 2018 00:00:00 PST) returns only items
                        with a property value on or before 2018-05-24T00:00:00-08:00.
                        If omitted or is invalid, there will be no upper limit, returning items based on other search criteria.
                        You can specify a date/time range by using *property_name*_from for the lower limit and *property_name*_to for the upper limit.
                        For example:<br>
                         `custom21_from=2018-05-24T00:00:00-08:00&custom21_to=2018-11-24T00:00:00-08:00`.<br><br>

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

      - name: facets
        in: query
        description: |
          Specifies which facets to return.

          Facets are a summary list of the most common occurrences for each facet type listed.
          For example, if `facets` specifies custom1, all items containing any value for custom1 are counted.
          The five items with the highest counts are returned.
          Facets allow users to anticipate selections, or to present a list of suggestions that the user will likely select.

          Multiple facets can be included using a comma-separated list.
          For example: `facets=custom1,custom2,custom9`.
          If this parameter is omitted, which is the default value, no facets are returned.
          Possible values are: custom1, custom2, custom3, custom4, custom5, custom6, custom7, custom8, custom9, custom10, custom11, custom12, custom29, and custom30.

          This parameter is often used along with the `results` parameter.
          If neither of the parameters are included, only the search results are returned.
          If `results=false`, and a facets value is specified, only the facets information is returned.
          If both the parameters are specified, both facets and search results are returned.
          If `results=false` and no valid facets parameters are specified, no data of either type is returned. However, an empty response object is returned.<br>

          <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request</font><br>
          In this example, the search is GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/recent-workspaces?results=false&facets=custom1,custom9`.
          The response JSON object does not include any search results.
          The facets section specified returning custom9 but there are no custom9 values to return.
          However, three custom1 values are returned, with *Microsoft* being the most common with 132 instances.

          The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
          The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
          For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

          The format is:<br>
          `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

          | Notation | Description |
          |:--- |:---|
          | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
          | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
          | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
          | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

          The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
          Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

          The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
           * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
           * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`

          The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
          The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
          For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

          The format is:<br>
          `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

          | Notation | Description |
          |:--- |:---|
          | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
          | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
          | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
          | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

          The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
          Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

          The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
           * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
           * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
           * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

          Examples:

          | Notation | Description |
          |:---:|:---|
          | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
          | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
          | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

        A category is a container that is used only in My Favorites and My Matters.
        A category can contain only other categories or shortcuts.
        The type of shortcuts it can contain depends on where the category exists.
        If used within My Favorites, it can contain folder and workspace shortcuts.
        If used within My Matters, it can contain only workspace shortcuts.<br><br>
        A category can contain other categories. These are called subcategories.<br>

  /work/api/v2/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/folders:
    description: |
      iManage Work organizes its content in a hierarchical container tree structure, similar to many computer operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows.
      In iManage Work, the tree structure is formed by two types of containers: Workspaces and Folders.
      * A workspace is a root-level container that can only be created at the library level. A workspace can contain only folders and tabs,
        but not documents or other workspaces.
      * A folder is created under a workspace or any other folder. It can contain subfolders and documents. A folder may contain any number of
        subfolders and be structured as needed. A folder created directly under a workspace is called a root-level folder. <br>
        Each folder is assigned a container ID which is a combination of its library name and a number. For example: active_uk!4532, where
        `active_uk` is the library name and 4532 is container number.

      The Folders collection includes requests to list folders, create folders, delete folders, modify profile properties and security,
      search for folders, and create subfolders.

          This is relative to zero, or the absolute start of the list.
          An offset value of zero starts at the beginning of the results set.

                    Some searches could return many fields, and not all are of interest for the search.
                    Therefore, this request specifies the fields to return.
                    By default, only the `id` and `wstype` fields are included.<br><br>
                    If more fields are needed to be returned, use the parameter `profile_fields` to specify those.
                    The parameter `profile_fields` is not required. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.
                    Items found during the search are still returned even if the search field specifying them is not included in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, the search can specify `owner=acase` but it does not have to include `owner` in the `profile_fields`.<br><br>

                    To return additional fields, specify both the object type and the fields in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, for the following request body specifies returning the `name` and `owner` fields.
                    This is in addition to the two default `id` and `wstype` fields.
                    ```
                    {
                      "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
                      "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "name", "owner"] }
                    }
                    ```
                    The parameter `profile_fields` can contain multiple entries, one for each of the following object types.<br><br>

                    |Type|Description|
                    |:---|:---|
                    |document|A document object.|
                    |email|A document object.|
                    |folder|A folder object.|
                    |workspace|A workspace object.|
                    |user|A user object.|

                    For each object type, specify additional fields.
                    If an object type is included but no objects of that type are returned, that object type entry is ignored.<br>

                    Multiple object types can also be included. The following example specifies the return fields for workspace and email:
                    ```
                    {
                      "profile_fields":
                      {
                        "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ],
                        "email": [ "sender", "title" ]
                      }
                    }
                    ```

                    The parameter `profile_fields` is often combined with the parameter `filters`, which defines the search criteria.
                    The following example returns workspaces that meet the `filters` criteria, and returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response:
                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields":
                        {
                          "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ]
                        },
                        "filters":
                        {
                          "custom1": "Enron",
                          "name": "Acquisitions"
                        }
                    }
                    ```
                filters:
                  type: object

                        For example, `include_ids=active_uk!22,active_uk!55,active_uk!401`

        This request returns one of two types of profile in the response depending upon the type of folder: regular folder and folder shortcut.<br>

        The regular folder profile consists of its various properties - for example, name, owner, custom properties, and default security.<br>

        The folder shortcut profile consists of additional information about the target folder - for example, target folder ID, library, folder type, and subtype.<br>

        If the query parameter `include_operations` is `true`, it also returns the list of operations allowed on the folder,
        such as moving the folder, deleting its content, and updating the default security. <br>

      summary: Delete a folder
      description: |
        Deletes the specified folder.
        A successful delete folder request does not return a response object.<br>

        A delete request fails if the following conditions are not satisfied:<br>

        1. The folder must not contain any child items.
        Folders being deleted independently or as part of a workspace deletion, cannot contain any subfolders or documents.
        Check for the folder children using the request:<br>
        GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/folders/{folderId}/children`

        2. The user must have the minimum of read/write access permission to that item and to all other attached items.
        This applies to all create, delete, and modify operations and is not unique to this operation.
        Check access permission for each library with the operations call:<br>
        GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/operations`

        Therefore, on encountering an error while deleting a folder, check the above conditions to determine the source of error.

        * access permission to users and groups

        **Default security**<br>
        The folders in iManage Work library are assigned with default security.<br>
        The following default security settings are available: <br>

        |Value|Description|
        |:---|:---|
        |inherit|The container or documents inherits security settings from its parent container.|
        |private|Only the user who created the container, and users and groups who are explicitly granted access permission, can access it.|
        |view|All users can access the container but cannot add or remove documents from the container unless explicitly assigned access permission.|
        |public|All users can access the container unless explicitly excluded. Users need to have the proper authority to create a public folder, or to change the security level to public.|

        **Access permission**<br>
        The owner of a document or a user with full access can assign specific access permission to individual users and groups.<br>
        When a group is granted access to a document, the same access permission are applied to all users who are members of the group.<br>

        Level of access permission assigned to users or groups to perform various actions on the object.<br>
        See the <a href="#overview--privileges">Privileges</a> section of the overview.

        The following are the possible values:

        |Term|Value|Description|
        |:---|:---|:---|
        |no_access|0|The user has no access, or any permissions to the container or document.|
        |read|1|The user can access the container, or read the document but cannot add or remove documents from the container unless explicitly assigned access permission.|
        |read_write|2|The user can access the container, or read and edit a document unless explicitly excluded.|
        |full_access|3|The user has complete access to the container or document, and may read, edit, or delete the document. The user may grant permissions to other users/groups, and can edit the document default security levels.|

        Creates a new search folder within another folder.<br>

        A search folder is a container that does not hold actual documents but instead holds links to the documents found from a search.
        When a search folder is first created, a search criteria is specified to search for documents. This criteria can be updated as needed.
        Each time the search folder is opened, it performs the search per the defined criteria and displays the results as links to the searched documents.
        A search folder can contain other folders and search folders, but not actual documents.<br>

        To create search folders at the root level of a workspace, use POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/search-folders`<br>

        The search criteria is specified using the `searchprofile` field.
        To modify the search criteria after the search folder is created, use PATCH `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/search-folders/{search_folder_id}`<br>

      Name-value pairs are customized properties for a folder and tab to store additional information.<br>

      Name-value pairs allow the storage of any additional information about the folder.
      These are in addition to the system-provided properties, and are saved separately from them.
      These properties are not validated by iManage Work system.
      They are different from custom fields, and are not a part of the object model, or a part of the object profile.
      The information is stored as a dictionary pair in the format `"key_name": "value"`.
      Any number of pairs can be stored.<br>

      Name-value pairs are allowed with the following object types:
      * Documents
      * Folders and tabs
      * Workspaces

      For example, the folder owner may need to store a trial or court date.
      As there is no property for this, a name-value pair can be created as `"trial_date": "2021-01-15T15:00:00.000000Z"`.<br>

      <font style="color:black;size:5">Using name-value-pairs requests</font><br><br>
      To return a list of name-value pair properties of a folder, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/folders/{folderId}/name-value-pairs`<br><br>
      The following request returns all the name-value pairs of the specified folder:<br>
      GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/folders/active_us!123/name-value-pairs`<br>

      <br>To create a new name-value pair, to modify the value of an existing one, or to delete a pair, use PATCH `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/folders/{folderId}/name-value-pairs`<br><br>
      This example continues the one above.
      * The first entry creates a new name-value pair `project_lead` with `ACASE` as the value.
      * The second entry modifies the existing `trial_date` to `2021-02-15T15:00:00.000000Z`.
      * The third entry deletes `prefix_document_name` by setting it to null.

                            Indicates the value of the document's checksum.

                            The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
                            It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

                            During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
                            If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
                            If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
                            If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

                            Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

        Adds a reference to a document that already exists in another folder to the specified folder.<br><br>
        If a document needs to be available in different locations in iManage Work, it can be added to multiple folders as a reference using this request.

        Following are the characteristics of a document reference:
        * A reference is a pointer to a document, and does not create a new copy of it in the folder.
        * The same document is linked from multiple folder locations. Hence, when a document is added to multiple folders, the document number remains the same.
        * A document is added as a reference when both the document and target folder are in the same database.
        When the document and folder are in different databases, a shortcut is created instead of a reference. <br>
        For more information, see the request `POST https://{hostname}/work/api/{version}/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/folders/{folderId}/document-shortcuts`
        * If the document properties or its content are updated in one folder, it is automatically reflected across all the document references in different folders.
        * When you restore a deleted document from trash, it is restored to all the locations it resided before the deletion.
        * A checked out document can also be added to folders.

                            Indicates the value of the document's checksum.

                            The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
                            It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

                            During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
                            If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
                            If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
                            If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

                            Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

                            This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive data from accidental or wrongful disclosure.

                            Therefore, even if this value is false, the document and email could still be encrypted.
                            Being identified by more than one source has no additional effect on encryption.

      summary: Import documents in supervised mode
      description: |
        Uploads a document to a folder in the supervised import mode.<br>

        This is a special mode that provides the option to set some of the document profile properties during import that are not available in the regular import.
        These properties include author, operator, owner, create_date, edit_date, edit_profile_date, file_create_date, file_edit_date, and document_number.

        The following are the features of Supervised import mode:
         * The minimum access permission required on the library to implement this request: NRTADMIN.
         * Import method is based on the value set for the parameter `supervised_import_type` as any of the following:
           * `new_doc_num` - Import the document with the new document number.
           * `specify_doc_num` - Specify the document number to be assigned. This mode requires additional document profile properties: `document_number` and `version`.
           The imported document is assigned with the document number and version provided by the user.
           *  `overwrite_doc` - Overwrite the existing document in the folder by the imported document.
           This mode requires additional document profile properties: `document_number` and `version`.
           The imported document overwrites the document whose document_number and version are provided by the user.
         * It allows to specify nearly all the profile fields in the request body including author, operator, create_date, edit_date, and so on.
         For the complete list of fields, see the *Body* section.
         * It allows to create document history entry for the document being uploaded, specified as `supervised_history`. This is an array of history fields.
        The order of the multipart/form-data must be document profile followed by the file content in the request body.

      A document shortcut is the hyperlink to a document in any iManage Work library. <br><br>
      Users can place shortcuts to frequently used documents at the desired locations. This allows them to quickly access these documents, and to better organize the data.<br>

      When a document is contained in a folder, it can be linked to another folder by creating a document shortcut.
      A link to the document appears in the destination folder, and it points to the document in source folder.
      When the user clicks the document shortcut, it opens the document to which it points to.

      The following minimum access permissions are required for the user:
      * Read/write on the destination folder.
      * Read access to the target document.

      The user who creates a document shortcut becomes the owner of the shortcut with full rights to change the name or description of it.
      If the properties of a shortcut are edited, the target document does not change.

        The content of a folder includes its subfolders and documents.<br>
        This POST search request provides the option to specify only the fields of interest to return in the response. <br>

        Based on the content type, the response includes the following default profile fields:
        * Subfolders - `id` and `wstype`
        * Documents - `id`, `wstype`, and `iwl`

        The other fields are returned by specifying them in the `profile_fields` parameter.
        This parameter is optional. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.<br>
        The search criteria is defined using the `filters` parameter.
        All the subfolders and documents matching the filter criteria are listed in the result. <br>

                    Specifies fields to return in the response JSON.<br><br>
                    Some searches could return many fields, and not all are of interest for the search.
                    Therefore, this request specifies the fields to return.
                    By default, only the `id` and `wstype` fields are included.<br><br>
                    If more fields are needed to be returned, use the parameter `profile_fields` to specify those.
                    The parameter `profile_fields` is not required. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.
                    Items found during the search are still returned even if the search field specifying them is not included in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, the search can specify `owner=acase` but it does not have to include `owner` in the `profile_fields`.<br><br>

                    To return additional fields, specify both the object type and the fields in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, for the following request body specifies returning the `name` and `owner` fields.
                    This is in addition to the two default `id` and `wstype` fields.
                    ```
                    {
                      "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
                      "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "name", "owner"] }
                    }
                    ```
                    The parameter `profile_fields` can contain multiple entries, one for each of the following object types.<br><br>

                    |Type|Description|
                    |:---|:---|
                    |document|A document object.|
                    |email|A document object.|
                    |folder|A folder object.|
                    |workspace|A workspace object.|
                    |user|A user object.|

                    For each object type, specify additional fields.
                    If an object type is included but no objects of that type are returned, that object type entry is ignored.<br>

                    Multiple object types can also be included. The following example specifies the return fields for workspace and email:
                    ```
                    {
                      "profile_fields":
                      {
                        "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ],
                        "email": [ "sender", "title" ]
                      }
                    }
                    ```

                    The parameter `profile_fields` is often combined with the parameter `filters`, which defines the search criteria.
                    The following example returns workspaces that meet the `filters` criteria, and returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response:
                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields":
                        {
                          "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ]
                        },
                        "filters":
                        {
                          "custom1": "Enron",

                        }
                    }

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:---:|:---|
                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
                        | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
                        | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

                        The two parameters of `edit_date_from` and `edit_date_to` can be used in combination to form a range.
                        For example, `edit_date_from=2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00&edit_date_to=2018-04-23T18:49:23Z` would return documents edited on or after 2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00 but before 2018-04-23T18:49:23Z.
                        If one parameter is omitted, the search would assume the current date for the other, if appropriate.
                      example: "2017-09-18T00:00:00Z"

                        For example, *Word*, *WordX*, *Acrobat*, *Powerpoint*. <br>
                        These values are not necessarily the same as the document type's extension field, which may be *doc*, *docx*, *pdf*, or *ppt*.<br>
                        Document type is not case sensitive, that is, *Word* matches with *word*.<br>
                        There is no stemming and the wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.
                        For example, *acrob* or *acrob&#42;* does not match *acrobat*.<br>
                        Multiple document types can be included using a comma-separated list.
                        For example, *type=WORD,WORDX,WORDXT*

                        <br>
                        To get a complete list of document types for a library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/types`.

                      description: |-
                        Indicates the document number of a document.

                        Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
                        and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
                        Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>
                        For example, if library ID is ACTIVE_UK, document number is 72634, and document version is 3, then document ID is `ACTIVE_UK!72634.3`.
                      example: 1
                    document_version:
                      type: integer
                      description: |-
                        Specifies the document version number.<br><br>
                        The document version number is the number of times a document has been edited.
                        For example, if the document ID is `active!72634.3`, the document version number is 3.<br><br>

                        When specifying document version numbers, either a single value can be included (`document_number=1`), or
                        a comma-separated list may be used to specify multiple document version numbers (`document_number=1,3`).

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:

                    If a `filters` parameter is included, returns only items matching all the filters.
                    For example, the following returns only items with a custom1 alias of *Enron* and has the name of *Acquisitions*.<br><br>

                    The parameter `filters` is often combined with the parameter `profile_fields`, which returns specified fields in the response object.
                    The following example returns documents that meet the `filters` requirements.
                    If this is a workspace object, it also returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response.

        Submits an email filing request to save Microsoft Outlook emails to iManage Work. 

        iManage Work Desktop for Windows provides the feature Email Management for Outlook that enables users to file emails from Outlook mailbox to iManage Work.
        For more information, see Email Management for Outlook (https://docs.imanage.com/work-help/10.2.6/en/Email_Management_for_Outlook.html)

        This request submits an email filing request. However, the email is actually filed when the request is successful, as filing
        is an asynchronous process by iManage Work Communication Server. <br>

        The following are email filing scenarios for users:
        * File an email to an iManage Work folder when sending it from Outlook.
        * File an existing email from an Outlook folder to iManage Work.
        * File an email automatically when moving it to an Outlook filing folder that is linked with iManage Work filing folder.

                      Also called *data at rest encryption*, the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
                      This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive information from accidental or wrongful disclosure.

        This request returns the preview of an email that is readable on the device accessing it.

        Depending upon the environment, it returns an email in following formats:
        * In some environments, an email in the MSG format is returned in the EML format.<br>
          When a user files an email from Microsoft Outlook, it is uploaded to iManage Work in the MSG format.
          Natively, iOS devices do not support opening the MSG file type. A document of this type needs to be converted
          to the EML format in order to render it on an iOS device.<br>

        * In other environments, emails in both MSG and EML formats are returned in the HTML format to be read on a web browser.

          Specifies the paging mode to be used to retrieve the result set.

          The following are allowed values:

          - standard_cursor - Specifies the query parameter `cursor`can be used to identify the first item to return.
          The cursor is a value that specifies an item by an ID within the results set to start returning from.
          It is not an ordinal position as `offset` is for the standard paging mode.
          For a subsequent search, set `cursor` to the cursor value returned in the previous search.
          Do not modify the cursor value in anyway.
          The standard_cursor mode is the preferred paging mode, as it is quicker and less stressful on system performance.
          The parameter `offset` is ignored in this mode.<br> **Note**: In this mode the search term must match the document name exactly.
          For example, when searching for `name=warrant`, documents with the name "warranty agreement" will not be included in the results.<br>

          - standard -  Specifies the query parameter `offset` can be used to identify the first item to return.
          The offset is a value that specifies the position of an item within the results set to start returning from.
          This is relative to zero, or the absolute start of the list.
          An offset value of zero starts at the beginning of the results set.
          An offset value of 5, starts with the fifth item in the results set.
          The parameter `cursor` is ignored in this mode.<br> **Note**: In this mode the search term can match the document name partially.
          For example, when searching for `name=warrant`, documents with the name "warranty agreement" will be included in the results.<br><br>

          Specifies the paging mode to be used to retrieve the result set.

          The following are allowed values:

          - standard_cursor - Specifies the query parameter `cursor`can be used to identify the first item to return.
          The cursor is a value that specifies an item by an ID within the results set to start returning from.
          It is not an ordinal position as `offset` is for the standard paging mode.
          For a subsequent search, set `cursor` to the cursor value returned in the previous search.
          Do not modify the cursor value in anyway.
          The standard_cursor mode is the preferred paging mode, as it is quicker and less stressful on system performance.
          The parameter `offset` is ignored in this mode.<br> **Note**: In this mode the search term must match the document name exactly.
          For example, when searching for `name=warrant`, documents with the name "warranty agreement" will not be included in the results.<br>

          - standard -  Specifies the query parameter `offset` can be used to identify the first item to return.
          The offset is a value that specifies the position of an item within the results set to start returning from.
          This is relative to zero, or the absolute start of the list.
          An offset value of zero starts at the beginning of the results set.
          An offset value of 5, starts with the fifth item in the results set.
          The parameter `cursor` is ignored in this mode.<br> **Note**: In this mode the search term can match the document name partially.
          For example, when searching for `name=warrant`, documents with the name "warranty agreement" will be included in the results.<br><br>

                    Specifies fields to return in the response JSON.<br><br>
                    Some searches could return many fields, and not all are of interest for the search.
                    Therefore, this request specifies the fields to return.
                    By default, only the `id` and `wstype` fields are included.<br><br>
                    If more fields are needed to be returned, use the parameter `profile_fields` to specify those.
                    The parameter `profile_fields` is not required. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.
                    Items found during the search are still returned even if the search field specifying them is not included in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, the search can specify `owner=acase` but it does not have to include `owner` in the `profile_fields`.<br><br>

                    To return additional fields, specify both the object type and the fields in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, for the following request body specifies returning the `name` and `owner` fields.
                    This is in addition to the two default `id` and `wstype` fields.
                    ```
                    {
                      "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
                      "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "name", "owner"] }
                    }
                    ```
                    The parameter `profile_fields` can contain multiple entries, one for each of the following object types.<br><br>

                    |Type|Description|
                    |:---|:---|
                    |document|A document object.|
                    |email|A document object.|
                    |folder|A folder object.|
                    |workspace|A workspace object.|
                    |user|A user object.|

                    For each object type, specify additional fields.
                    If an object type is included but no objects of that type are returned, that object type entry is ignored.<br>

                    Multiple object types can also be included. The following example specifies the return fields for workspace and email:
                    ```
                    {
                      "profile_fields":
                      {
                        "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ],
                        "email": [ "sender", "title" ]
                      }
                    }
                    ```

                    The parameter `profile_fields` is often combined with the parameter `filters`, which defines the search criteria.
                    The following example returns workspaces that meet the `filters` criteria, and returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response:
                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields":
                        {
                          "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ]
                        },
                        "filters":
                        {

                        Returns documents that have been edited between two dates relative to the current date.<br><br>
                        The format is [begin]:[end][timescale]. The time scale is 'd' for days, 'm' for months, 'y' for years.
                        These dates are relative to each other, and do not refer to calendar dates.
                        For example, `-30:0d` indicates the beginning date is 30 days prior to the current date (noted by the negative sign),
                        and the end date is zero days from the current date, or from today. `-30:-7d` indicates the beginning date is 30 days
                        prior to the current date but that the end date is seven days prior to the current date.
                        A positive number indicates a date in the future and the search is limited to the current date as appropriate and should be avoided.
                        For example, `-30:+7d` indicates the end date is seven days after the current date, a week in the future.
                      example: -30:0d

                        Returns documents that were edited on or after this date (in ISO 8601 format).<br><br>
                        The parameters `edit_date_from` and `edit_date_to` are used in combination to form a date range.
                        For example, `edit_date_from=2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00&edit_date_to=2018-04-23T18:49:23Z` returns documents edited
                        on or after 2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00 but before 2018-04-23T18:49:23Z.
                        If one parameter is omitted, the search assumes the current date for the other, if appropriate.
                      example: "2017-09-18T00:00:00Z"

                        Specifies documents of the document type.<br><br>

                        Each iManage Work system has a customizable list of document types per the organizational requirements.
                        For example, *Word*, *WordX*, *Acrobat*, *Powerpoint*. <br>
                        These values are not necessarily the same as the document type's extension field, which may be *doc*, *docx*, *pdf*, or *ppt*.<br>
                        Document type is not case sensitive, that is, *Word* matches with *word*.<br>
                        There is no stemming and the wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.
                        For example, *acrob* or *acrob&#42;* does not match *acrobat*.<br>
                        Multiple document types can be included using a comma-separated list.
                        For example, *type=WORD,WORDX,WORDXT*

                        <br>
                        To get a complete list of document types for a library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/types`.

                        A property alias is an entry for that custom property.
                        For example, `custom1` can be captioned as *Client*.
                        It can have multiple entries, such as 001, 001abc, 001001. These are known as aliases of clients.
                        These aliases can be associated with client descriptions such as Ajubalaw, Microsoft, and Wallachs.

                        * This search is not case-sensitive.

                        Indicates the document number of a document.

                        Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
                        and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
                        Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>
                        For example, if library ID is ACTIVE_UK, document number is 72634, and document version is 3, then document ID is `ACTIVE_UK!72634.3`.
                      example: 123 "123" "123,124"

                        Specifies the document version number.<br><br>
                        The document version number is the number of times a document has been edited.
                        For example, if the document ID is `active!72634.3`, the document version number is 3.<br><br>

                        When specifying document version numbers, either a single value can be included (`document_number=1`), or
                        a comma-separated list may be used to specify multiple document version numbers (`document_number=1,3`).
                      example: 1 "1" "1,2"

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:---:|:---|
                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
                        | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
                        | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

                        For example, `-30:0d` indicates the beginning date is 30 days prior to the current date (noted by the negative sign), and the end date is zero days from the current date, or from today.
                        `-30:-7d` indicates the beginning date is 30 days prior to the current date and the end date is seven days prior to the current date.
                        A positive number indicates a date in the future and the search is limited to the current date as appropriate and should be avoided.

                    If a `filters` parameter is not included, all items are returned.
                    If a `filters` parameter is included, returns only items matching all the filters.
                    For example, the following returns only items with a custom1 alias of *Enron* and has the name of *Acquisitions*.<br><br>

                    ```
                      {
                        "filters" :
                        {
                          "custom1" : "Enron",
                          "name"    : "Acquisitions"
                        }
                      }
                    ```

                    The parameter `filters` is often combined with the parameter `profile_fields`, which returns specified fields in the response object.
                    The following example returns documents that meet the `filters` requirements.
                    If this is a workspace object, it also returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response.

                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields" :

        ## POST customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/documents/my-checked-out
        Returns all the checked-out documents of the current user with the specified document profile fields in the response. <br><br>
        The GET search returns many fields, and not all may be required.
        This POST search request provides the option to specify only the fields of interest to return in the response. <br>

        By default, the response includes `id`, `wstype`, and `iwl`.<br>
        The other fields are returned by setting the `profile_fields` parameter. This parameter is optional. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.<br>
        The search criteria is defined using the `filters` parameter. <br>

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        The following request returns up to 25 checked-out documents having `custom1` as `001`, and the specified `profile_fields` in the response:<br>

                    iManage Work returns date values in UTC. Timezone offset can be used to translate UTC to the local time for display in the client application.
                    The value may be positive (minutes ahead of UTC) or negative (minutes behind UTC).
                    For example, India is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC, which is 330 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=330`.
                    Houston is six hours behind UTC, which is -360 minutes, and is specified as `timezone_offset=-360`.

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:---:|:---|
                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
                        | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
                        | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

                        The two parameters of `edit_date_from` and `edit_date_to` can be used in combination to form a range. For example, **edit_date_from=2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00&edit_date_to=2018-04-23T18:49:23Z** would return documents edited on or after 2017-08-12T11:53:40-07:00 but before 2018-04-23T18:49:23Z. If one parameter is omitted, the search would assume the current date for the other, if appropriate.

                        Each iManage Work system has a customizable list of document types per the organizational requirements.
                        For example, *Word*, *WordX*, *Acrobat*, *Powerpoint*. <br>
                        These values are not necessarily the same as the document type's extension field, which may be *doc*, *docx*, *pdf*, or *ppt*.<br>
                        Document type is not case sensitive, that is, *Word* matches with *word*.<br>
                        There is no stemming and the wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.
                        For example, *acrob* or *acrob&#42;* does not match *acrobat*.<br>
                        Multiple document types can be included using a comma-separated list.
                        For example, *type=WORD,WORDX,WORDXT*

                        <br>

                        For example, `custom1` can be captioned as *Client*.
                        It can have multiple entries, such as 001, 001abc, 001001. These are known as aliases of clients.
                        These aliases can be associated with client descriptions such as Ajubalaw, Microsoft, and Wallachs.

                        * This search is not case-sensitive.
                        * Partial matches are not supported.
                        * The wildcard character (&ast;) is not supported.

                          For example, all the following searches match with `litigation`:

                        Indicates the document number of a document.

                        Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
                        and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
                        Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>
                        For example, if library ID is ACTIVE_UK, document number is 72634, and document version is 3, then document ID is `ACTIVE_UK!72634.3`.
                      example: 1
                    document_version:
                      type: integer
                      description: |-
                        Specifies the document version number.<br><br>
                        The document version number is the number of times a document has been edited.
                        For example, if the document ID is `active!72634.3`, the document version number is 3.<br><br>

                        When specifying document version numbers, either a single value can be included (`document_number=1`), or
                        a comma-separated list may be used to specify multiple document version numbers (`document_number=1,3`).
                      example: 1
                    create_date:
                      pattern: ^(([-+]?\d+)([dDwWmMyY])?(:([-+]?(\d+)))([dDwWmMyY]))|(([-+]?\d+)([dDwWmMyY])(:([-+]?(\d+)))([dDwWmMyY])?)|^([-+]?\d+[dDwWmMyY])$

                        The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
                        The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
                        For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

                        The format is:<br>
                        `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:--- |:---|
                        | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
                        | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
                        | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
                        | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

                        The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
                        Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

                        The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
                         * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
                         * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
                         * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

                        Examples:

                        | Notation | Description |
                        |:---:|:---|
                        | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
                        | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
                        | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

                    If a `filters` parameter is not included, all items are returned.
                    If a `filters` parameter is included, returns only items matching all the filters.
                    For example, the following returns only items with a custom1 alias of *Enron* and has the name of *Acquisitions*.<br><br>

                    ```
                      {

                    ```

                    The parameter `filters` is often combined with the parameter `profile_fields`, which returns specified fields in the response object.
                    The following example returns documents that meet the `filters` requirements.
                    If this is a workspace object, it also returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response.

        Returns a list of immediate parent folders of the specified documents.

        A document-folder relation is created when a document is uploaded to a folder or added as a reference to it.
        The sample use case for this request would be to identify the documents that are referenced in multiple folders.

        Important characteristics of this request:

        * The document numbers are passed to retrieve the respective parent folder numbers. The document ID is not accepted by this request.
        * The response returns information only about the documents that exist, and have document-folder relations.
        * If a document is referred in multiple folders, each document-folder relation is returned in the response.
        * An empty response is returned if all the specified documents do not exist, or they do not have document-folder relations.

      The users can check out individual documents from a library for using them outside of the iManage Work system.

      For working on a document, it is checked out of iManage Work and a local copy of it is created in the specified location on the local or network drive.
      The user can edit it in the local applications, and then check it back into iManage Work.<br>

      When a document is checked out of a library, other users have read-only access to the document until it is checked in.

                    This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive data from accidental or wrongful disclosure.
                    Documents and emails can be encrypted by different sources.
                    Therefore, even if this value is false, the document and email could still be encrypted.
                    Being identified by more than one source has no additional effect on encryption.

      iManage Work saves multiple versions of a document.<br><br>
      When a document is imported that already exists in iManage Work library, a new version is created for the imported document.
      iManage Work automatically checks out the existing document in order to create and check in the new version of a document.
      The existing document and new document retain the same document number with different version numbers.
      The next highest version number is assigned to the new version of the document.<br>
      For example, if version 1 of a document currently exists, then the new version of the document is created as version 2,
      but the document number remains same.

                            Indicates the value of the document's checksum.

                            The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
                            It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

                            During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
                            If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
                            If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
                            If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

                            Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

      summary: Promote document version
      description: |-
        Creates a new version of the document from an existing saved state of the contents of the document.

        This request may not be available for all environments.
        To check the availability of this feature, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`.<br>
        If `promote_journal` is `true`, this feature is available.<br>
        Additionally, if `copy_as_new_version` is `true`, this request can be used to copy an existing version as a new version.

        A document state can be promoted by specifying one of the following:
        * `journal_id` - the ID of an entry from the document's history.
        * `version`

        Note: One of these two parameters must be specified. Specifying both of these parameters is not allowed.

        If the promotion operation is delayed, the response may contain a `status` array. The entries in this array will be
        sent by the server one at a time - each one indicating the latest progress of the operation. Upon completion of
        the operation, the remainder of the response will be sent.

        **Promoting a document state using `journal_id`:**<br>
        Journaling preserves a copy of the document's contents for each change that is saved, regardless of whether a new
        version is created. Every saved state of a document's contents is a **journal**.

        Most actions performed on a document create history entries for that document. When retrieving a document's history,
        some entries will have the property `has_journal` equal to true. This means that the history entry is a reference to
        a journal. The ID of such a history entry is a `journal_id` and can be used with this request.

        The following operations in a document's history hold a reference to a journal
        * **Save and Sync** operation that overwrites the current version of the document
        * **Print** operation
        * **Edit** operation

        Note: A **Save and Sync** operation creates a new journal. However, the history entry created as a result of this
        operation points to the journal containing the document's contents as they were **prior** to the Save and Sync operation.
        In other words, it points to the previous journal. Hence, the intention of calling this request with a `journal_id` is
        to effectively revert the action referenced by the given `journal_id`.

        When promoting using `journal_id`, the new document profile will be constructed as follows:
        * `type` and `extension` will be inherited from the journal being promoted.
        * `operator` and `operator_description` will be the user making the promote request.
        * `last_user` and `last_user_description` will be the user making the promote request.
        * The following date/time fields will be set to the time of the request:
          * `create_date`
          * `edit_date`
          * `edit_profile_date`
          * `file_create_date`
          * `file_edit_date`
        * Values for all remaining profile fields can be provided using the `doc_profile` parameter of this request.
        If not provided, they will be inherited from the latest version visible to the user making the promote request.

        Users can promote a document's state using `journal_id` only if both of the conditions below are satisifed:
        * They have at least Read/Write access to the version of the document identified by the `journal_id`.
        * The latest version of the document is not checked out.

        *Example use case: promoting an un-versioned change*<br>
        A user has edited and saved a document multiple times, prior to checking it in as a new version. They now want
        to revert some of the last changes they saved before checking in. This can be accomplished through this request,
        by providing the `journal_id` of the earliest unwated change. A new version of the document will be created,
        whose contents will be the same as they were prior to the action referenced by the provided `journal_id`.

        **Promoting a document state using `version`:**<br>
        This is useful if the desired state of the document's contents is not an intermediate journal but an actual
        document version.

        When promoting using `version`, the new document profile will be constructed as follows:
        * `type` and `extension` will be inherited from the version being promoted.
        * `operator` and `operator_description` will be the user making the promote request.
        * `last_user` and `last_user_description` will be the user making the promote request.
        * The following date/time fields will be set to the time of the request:
          * `create_date`
          * `edit_date`

        * Values for all remaining profile fields can be provided using the `doc_profile` parameter of this request.
        If not provided, they will be inherited from the version being promoted.

        Users can promote a document's state by version only if both of the conditions below are satisifed:
        * They have at least Read/Write access to the specified version of the document.
        * The latest version of the document is not checked out.

        *Example use case: promoting an older version*<br>
        An older version of the document has the desired state. This request can be used to promote that state to
        the latest verison.

      **Default Security**<br>
      The documents in iManage Work library are assigned with default security.<br><br>
      The default security settings available are as follows: <br>

      |Value|Description|
      |---|---|
      |private|Only the user who created the document, and other users or groups to whom the access is granted specifically can see it.|
      |public|All users can view and edit the document unless explicitly excluded.|
      |view|All users can view the document unless explicitly granted Read/Write or No Access.|

      If a user is assigned with explicit access permission as well as group privilege to a document, then the user gets the maximum level of
      access to the document granted by the two explicit assignments. <br>
      For example, if a document is marked `private`, but a specific user is granted `read_write` access, and the group to which the user belongs to
      is granted only `read` access, then the user gets `read_write` access to the document.

      **access permission**<br>
      The owner of a document or a user with full access can assign specific access permission to individual users and groups.<br>
      When a group is granted access to a document, the same access permission are applied to all users who are members of the group.<br>

      |Value|Description|
      |---|---|
      |no_access| The user cannot see the document. The document does not show up in any search performed by this user. If the document is in a public folder, users who have No Access to the document do not see the document when they click on that folder.|
      |read| The user can view the document in read-only form, but cannot make changes and save it to the library as the same document.|
      |read_write| The user can view and edit the document and change most of its properties. The user cannot change the Author or Operator or edit access permission. Only the Author or Operator and those to whom they grant Full Access can edit these fields.|
      |full_access| The user can view and edit the document, change its properties and security settings. The Author and Operator have Full Access, and they can grant Full Access to others.|

      Document relations are created to link the related documents together. 

      Document relations allow grouping and easy access to documents filed in different locations throughout iManage Work.
      A document can be related to more than one document in the same library.
      Users can set relations between documents that are associated with each other and are needed for reference in the future.<br>

      For example, a contract and its amendments, a contract and riders to the contract, and so on.
      You can also use document relations to link a document with the documents that were used to create it,
      such as a final report with its inserts, such as spreadsheets, graphics files, tables, figures, and charts.

      Name-value pairs are customized properties for a document to store additional information.<br>

      These requests provide the flexibility to store the additional properties for the specific organizational needs.
      For example, there may be a requirement to prefix some of the document names with custom1 property alias.
      A name-value pair property `prefix_document_name` can be created with the possible values `true` and `false`.
      This property can be used to apply the prefix to selected documents. <br>

      The name-value pair properties are saved separately from the other standard document properties.<br>
      The data in requests is provided in the name and value format as follows:<br>

        * A non-administrative user assigned to a role with `checkout` privilege can lock a document if any of the following are true:
          * The document is public.
          * The user is the Author or Operator of the document.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Important to know</font><br>
        1. When a document is checked out, that is, opened for editing, it is downloaded from iManage Work to a location on the user's hard drive
        or network drive as a local copy. 
        2. The document is locked during this time so other users must wait for the document to be checked in before they can edit it. 
        The checkin process also unlocks the document. 
        3. All changes to the document are first saved locally. The user completes editing the document and checks it in back to iManage Work. 
        At this point the document is unlocked and available for other users to check out and edit. 
        4. If the local copy becomes unexpectedly unavailable, it is not available for checking in or unlocking.
        This could be for several reasons, such as the local copy gets corrupted, deleted, or the drive is unavailable.
        In this case, the document remains locked in iManage Work and must be unlocked to make it available for all users.
        For more information, see <a href="#delete-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/libraries/-libraryId-/documents/-docId-/lock"> Unlock a document.</a>
        5. After unlocking, the last version available in iManage Work becomes the current version.

          Filters document activities based on the end date and time (in ISO 8601 format) of an activity.

          The date can be specified in one of two formats.
          * The standard iManage ISO 8601 format. This is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.µZ.
          µ represents zero or more microseconds.
          For example: 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229Z
          * The standard iManage ISO 8601 format with offset. This is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.µ∓hh.mm.
          µ represents zero or more microseconds.
          For example: 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229+02.00.
          The values at the end are an offset (to the nearest minute), moving the time ahead or behind.
          This can be used to inline the time difference.
          For example, India is five and half hours ahead of London, so a date from London can be set to 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229+05.30 to match Indian time.

                            Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
                            and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
                            Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>

                            If `true`, the document activity has a journal entry attached to it. For example, a journal entry is available when the document content is updated and saved.<br>
                            If `false`, the document activity does not have a journal entry. For example, viewing a document does not create a journal entry.

          The date can be specified in one of two formats.
          * The standard iManage ISO 8601 format. This is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.µZ.
          µ represents zero or more microseconds.
          For example: 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229Z
          * The standard iManage ISO 8601 format with offset. This is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.µ∓hh.mm.
          µ represents zero or more microseconds.
          For example: 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229+02.00.
          The values at the end are an offset (to the nearest minute), moving the time ahead or behind.
          This can be used to inline the time difference.
          For example, India is five and half hours ahead of London, so a date from London can be set to 2019-10-29T11:44:24.229+05.30 to match Indian time.

        When a user performs a keyword search on a document in iManage Work application, the stemmed term related to the search key is
        expanded and highlighted in the document. The original search term is also highlighted. <br>
        These highlights help a user to search and navigate to the relevant sections in the document. <br>

        For example, the search for keyword *fishing* in a document is stemmed as *fish*, and the terms *fishing*, *fished*, *fisher*, and *fishery* are highlighted in the document.
        This request returns all such expanded terms.

        Replaces or updates the contents of a document. <br>
        This request can update both profile and content of a document. The new content completely replaces the existing one.<br>

        This API supports document checksum computation and validation.
        Checksum is a sequence of letters and numbers that can be used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.
        During file upload, this API computes the checksum of the content and saves it along with metadata. <br>

        If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum. <br>
        If the checksum values do not match, a 400-error is returned. <br>
        If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, then the validation is not performed.<br>
        The checksum type is indicated in the prefix of the checksum property returned in the API response.
        SHA256 is the only supported checksum type currently. For example, SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1
        The checksum feature is available only if the `document_checksum` feature is enabled.

        Downloads a document {docId} with a rate-limited time restriction.<br><br>
        Downloads are rate limited, meaning only a certain number of downloads can be served within a time window.
        The request returns appropriate response headers according to [Rate Limiting Headers RFC Section 1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-00.html#rfc.section.1.2)<br>
        An error occurs if a download exceeds the allowed quota within the time frame.<br>

        The file is downloaded as a file stream.
        Therefore, the stream must be captured and explicitly saved with a file name including the file extension, such as `.docx` or `.pdf`.
        The document name is returned in the header tag *Document-Id*.<br>

        This request may not be available for all environments.
        Prior to executing this request, check GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`.<br>
        If `rate_limited_downloads` is `false`, this request is not available.<br>

                              Indicates the value of the document's checksum.

                              The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
                              It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

                              During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
                              If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
                              If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
                              If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

                              Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

                              Data encryption is a security measure that prevents visibility of documents in the case of unauthorized access or theft.
                              Also called *data at rest encryption*, the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
                              This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive information from accidental or wrongful disclosure.

        * The term check-out describes the process of getting a version of a document from a library.
        * The term check-in describes the process of adding a new or modified document to a library.
        * When a document is checked out, it is locked so other users must wait for the document to be checked in before they can edit it. 
          Therefore, by checking out a document, a user can prevent others from editing it.
        * By checking in a document, the user allows other users to edit the document, without needing to worry about overriding changes that others have made.
        * While a document is checked out, other users can see only the last version that was checked in.

        * When a user needs to work on a document in a non-integrated application or away from the network connection, 
          it can be checked out from a library for using it outside of the iManage Work system.
        * When a document is checked out, a local copy of it is created in the specified location.
          The user can edit it using the local applications, and then check it back into iManage Work.
        * A user can checkout a particular version of a document out of multiple versions. 
        * While the document is checked out, other users have `read-only` access to the document until it is checked in.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Required authorization</font><br>
        A user is not required to have any special privileges to execute this request.<br>

      The directory sync APIs support bulk import of global users and groups for the customers into iManage Work system. <br>
      The directory sync runs regularly per the configured sync-schedule for the customer's directory-sync client application.
      During each such sync, only the affected records are added, updated, or disabled. 

      The directory sync client application first fetches hashes for all the Microsoft Active Directory users, groups, and group memberships from iManage.
      The hashes are encrypted values for the original user and group profile data. Then it calculates hashes for users, groups,
      and group memberships based on the current information in the customer’s identity provider (IDP) and the client application’s configuration.
      The directory sync client then compares the calculated hashes to the ones it retrieved from iManage in order to determine which users,
      groups, and group memberships need to be added, updated, or disabled. After determining the changes, it sends updates only for
      the affected users, groups, and group memberships to iManage Work.

      summary: Search for custom property aliases
      description: |-
        Searches aliases from the specified custom property.

        Searching custom2 or custom30 returns all aliases from the property, regardless of their parent alias.
        To limit the search to a specific parent alias, use the parameter `parent_alias`.
        For example, to see custom2 aliases only from the parent alias of *Microsoft*, use `parent_alias=Microsoft`.

        There are both GET and POST versions of certain searches. Consider the following to identify the version to be used:<br>

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Difference between GET and POST searches</font><br>

        GET:
        * This version is simpler and easier to implement.
        * Some of the requests return facets that provide certain criteria to users to refine their search results.
          Facets list the most relevant five properties of iManage Work objects, which provide users with the option to narrow results
          by several dimensions simultaneously.
          For example, a document search can return the `custom1` facet.
          It returns the aggregated result of documents based on the five most logical and relevant custom1 aliases.
          Facets can be used to anticipate user selections, or to present a list of suggestions that the user will likely select.
          For example, frequent custom1 aliases can be added at the top of a selection list, so that users do not have to scroll through the entire list.

        POST:
        * Use this version if you are making a series of searches, or require a large number of search filters.
          This is the preferred version, as it is quicker and less stressful for the iManage Work system.
        * This version allows a greater number of search filters, either as query parameters or through the `filter` parameter.
        * This version allows a greater number of items for each filter.
          For example, POST `customers/{customerId}/users/search` can take an array of large number of user IDs,
          whereas the request GET `customers/{customerId}/users` is limited to the endpoint character limit.
        * Some requests allow to specify the fields to return through the `profile_fields` parameter.
          Returning specific fields can make parsing the response easier, and is less stressful for the iManage Work system.

          Data encryption is a security measure that prevents visibility of documents in the case of unauthorized access or theft.
          Also called *data at rest encryption*, the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
          This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive information from accidental or wrongful disclosure.

          The enforcement of encryption varies by iManage Work environment.
          Depending on the iManage Work environment, encryption can be either automatic for all documents, or specified explicitly through custom properties.
          For more information, contact your iManage Work system administrator.

        * This version allows a greater number of items for each filter.
          For example, POST `customers/{customerId}/users/search` can take an array of large number of user IDs,
          whereas the request GET `customers/{customerId}/users` is limited to the endpoint character limit.
        * Some requests allow to specify the fields to return through the `profile_fields` parameter.
          Returning specific fields can make parsing the response easier, and is less stressful for the iManage Work system.

        This creates a custom property alias for custom1 through custom12, custom29, and custom30.

        The aliases for the custom properties are validated.
        That means, if an object is being assigned an alias from one of these properties,
        that alias must already be present.
        If it is not present at the time the assignment is validated, an error occurs.
        For example, if a document's custom1 field is being assigned the alias `Microsoft`, `Microsoft` must already be an enabled alias for custom1.

          The date range is specified with the daterange notation, such as -30:0d.
          The notation is set of two dates offsets that are relative to the current date.
          For example, *-30* in the previous example specifies the start of the range to be 30 days previous to the current date.

          The format is:<br>
          `[-][begin]:[-][end][timescale]`<br>

          | Notation | Description |
          |:--- |:---|
          | - | The subtraction sign (-) specifies time prior to the current date. Omitting the subtraction sign (-) specifies time after the current date. The subtraction sign is used more commonly, although see the notes below for referring to a date in the future. |
          | begin | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to begin the range from. |
          | end | The number of units (see timescale) prior to the current date to end the date range.  |
          | timescale | The time interval for the date range. `d` is for days, `m` is for months, `y` is for years. |

          The values for `begin` and `end` must be whole numbers, and can be noted as positive or negative.
          Positive time units, indicated by not having a negative sign, is a time in the future. This is used to compensate for time zone differences.

          The following are incorrect notations that result in error:
           * An addition sign, such as `-30:+1d`
           * A fraction value, such as `-30.5:1d`
           * An end date before the begin date, such as `-7:-30d`

          Examples:

          | Notation | Description |
          |:---:|:---|
          | -30:0d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through the current date. |
          | -30:-7d | The range is from 30 days prior to the current date through seven days before current date. |
          | -26w:-1m | The range is from 26 weeks prior to the current date through one month before the current date. |

      summary: Create a KM tag for a document
      description: |
        Creates a knowledge management (KM) tag on a document.

        This request may not be available for all environments.
        Prior to executing this request, check GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`.<br>
        If `km_tags` is `true`, this request is available.

        Important characteristics of this request:
        * The user must have read-write access privelege to the document to create a tag.
        * The non-adminstrative users can create tags only with their user ID. Therefore, the `user_id` in the request body
          must match with the the caller's user ID.
        * The system administrators can create tags for other users as well.
        * If the `user_id` property is not specified, the request considers the default value as the caller's user ID.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Sample request(s)</font><br>
        The following request creates the private tag AJUBALAW_ROCKETINDUSTRIES on the document active_uk!456.1 for the user ACASE:

      KM tags allow the creation and persistence of knowledge management (hence KM) metadata values. The tags can be associated with either specific documents (document number and version) or containers (objects like folders, categories, etc). Each tag is also associated with a specific user (user only, no groups) and has a security value (public or private). Tags also have an associated object type (tag, comment, vote, app defined), and track creation and edit times.

        Creates a knowledge management (KM) tag on a container such as folders, workspaces, and category.

        This request may not be available for all environments.
        Prior to executing this request, check GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`.<br>
        If `km_tags` is `true`, this request is available.

        Important characteristics of this request:
        * The user must have read-write access privelege to the container to create a tag.
        * The non-adminstrative users can create tags only with their user ID. Therefore, the `user_id` in the request body
          must match with the the caller's user ID.
        * The system administrators can create tags for other users as well.
        * If the `user_id` property is not specified, the request considers the default value as the caller's user ID.

          The full-text indexer prepares the document's contents for search performance and versatility.
          It indexes words and phrases to quickly find them.
          It also expands some terms to include stemming, common variations, and enables logical find statements, such as AND and OR.
          If full-text indexing is not used, the terms are still indexed but only as exact literals.

          For example, documents used for OCR (optical character recognition) and COMPARE (an iManage tool for tracking changes within a document) contain system information related to those functions and tools.
          Therefore, users may want to exclude the contents of those documents from searches.

          This requires that the feature `document_class_indexable` is available on this platform.
          The `document_class_indexable` is a feature that allows documents of this document class to be excluded from being returned from document searches.
          Check GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`.<br>
          The feature is available if `document_class_indexable` is `true`.<br>
          The feature is not available if `document_class_indexable` is `false` or is omitted from the results. In this case, documents from this document class will always be included in search results.

          If the feature `document_class_indexable` is `true`, set the `indexable` property.
          * If set to `true`, documents of this document class are included in search results.
          * If set to `false`, documents of this document class are excluded from search results.
          * If set to null or is omitted, `indexable` is considered to be `true`.

          If these two conditions are met (`document_class_indexable` is `true` and `indexable` is `false`), documents of this document class are excluded from a *full-index search*.
          A full-index search is a document search that includes a value for any of the following search parameters: `title`, `body`, `comments`, and `anywhere`.
          Documents meeting these requirements are excluded from the search results even if it meets other document search criteria.
          For example, a document search for `content=litigation&custom1=Microsoft` will exclude documents, regardless if it otherwise matches `custom1=Microsoft`.

          If the document search is not a full-index search (that is, does not contain a value for any of the parameters `title`, `body`, `comments`, and `anywhere`), it is considered a *database search*.
          A database search returns any document meeting the search criteria.
          That means, as long as the document search is not a full-index search, those documents are returned in the search results.
          For example, a document search for `custom1=Microsoft` will return all documents meeting that criterion, regardless of their document class property `indexable` value.     type: boolean

                            It also expands some terms to include stemming, common variations, and enables logical find statements, such as AND and OR.
                            If full-text indexing is not used, the terms are still indexed but only as exact literals.

                    If `true`, documents of this document class are indexed by the full-text indexer.<br>
                    If `false`, documents of this document class will not be indexed by the full-text indexer.<br>
                    If omitted, the value is `true`.

                    The full-text indexer prepares the document's contents for search performance and versatility.
                    It indexes words and phrases to quickly find them.
                    It also expands some terms to include stemming, common variations, and enables logical find statements, such as AND and OR.
                    If full-text indexing is not used, the terms are still indexed but only as exact literals.

                    <font style="color:black;size:5">Excluding documents from as search</font><br>
                    Some kinds of document contents do not provide meaningful information for users.
                    For example, documents used for OCR (optical character recognition) and COMPARE (an iManage tool for tracking changes within a document) contain system information related to those functions and tools.
                    Therefore, users may want to exclude the contents of those documents from searches.

                    This requires that the feature `document_class_indexable` is available on this platform.
                    The `document_class_indexable` is a feature that allows documents of this document class to be excluded from being returned from document searches.
                    Check GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`.<br>
                    The feature is available if `document_class_indexable` is `true`.<br>
                    The feature is not available if `document_class_indexable` is `false` or is omitted from the results. In this case, documents from this document class will always be included in search results.

                    If the feature `document_class_indexable` is `true`, set the `indexable` property.
                    * If set to `true`, documents of this document class are included in search results.
                    * If set to `false`, documents of this document class are excluded from search results.
                    * If set to null or is omitted, `indexable` is considered to be `true`.

                    If these two conditions are met (`document_class_indexable` is `true` and `indexable` is `false`), documents of this document class are excluded from a *full-index search*.
                    A full-index search is a document search that includes a value for any of the following search parameters: `title`, `body`, `comments`, and `anywhere`.
                    Documents meeting these requirements are excluded from the search results even if it meets other document search criteria.
                    For example, a document search for `content=litigation&custom1=Microsoft` will exclude documents, regardless if it otherwise matches `custom1=Microsoft`.

                    If the document search is not a full-index search (that is, does not contain a value for any of the parameters `title`, `body`, `comments`, and `anywhere`), it is considered a *database search*.
                    A database search returns any document meeting the search criteria.
                    That means, as long as the document search is not a full-index search, those documents are returned in the search results.
                    For example, a document search for `custom1=Microsoft` will return all documents meeting that criterion, regardless of their document class property `indexable` value.

                    The feature is not available if `document_class_indexable` is `false` or is omitted from the results. In this case, documents from this document class will always be included in search results.

                    If the feature `document_class_indexable` is `true`, set the `indexable` property.

                    If the document search is not a full-index search (that is, does not contain a value for any of the parameters `title`, `body`, `comments`, and `anywhere`), it is considered a *database search*.
                    A database search returns any document meeting the search criteria.

                    Data encryption is a security measure that prevents visibility of documents in the case of unauthorized access or theft.
                    Also called *data at rest encryption*, the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
                    This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive information from accidental or wrongful disclosure.

                    Document shadowing (also called document echoing) is the ability to retain a copy of the document on the user's local computer after it is checked in.
                    Some organizations recognize that there can be a security issue by having document copies outside of the iManage Work system.
                    By some best practices, the use of document shadowing is prohibited or discouraged.

      They are friendly or descriptive labels for these fields.
      For example, you can create a caption for the *custom1* field as *Client*.
      Any changes to these names are reflected dynamically in the UI.
      Captions can also be defined per client application's locale settings for a language.

        The returned JSON field **data > user > customer_id** contains the customer ID.
        This unique value is permanently assigned to the iManage Work system and needs to be checked only once when the application first runs each time.

    description: |
      A group defines a sets of users who are intended to have identical access permission to containers and documents.
      For example, if a group has access to a document, all users in that group can access the document. A group can then be added to a
      container's or document's default security. This helps to provide the same access to all the members of a group together.
      It is important to note that groups do not have privileges assigned to them. That is, a group is not defined to have access
      to a container or document. Instead, a container or document must have that group added to its default security list.
      Groups can be created, and modified as required, with the exception of the NRTADMIN group. See NRTADMIN Group for more information. Groups cannot be deleted.
      If the directory server from which the user list is maintained already includes groups, those groups and members can be imported into iManage Work. This is a one-way synchronization only; groups and memberships cannot be updated from iManage Work back to the directory service.

                                It is formatted internally to all upper case letters, and then saved as `id`.
                                The request fields `id` and `user_id_ex` should be same but the letter case can be different.<br>

                                      This is applicable to virtual users only (whose `user_nos=2`).

                                      If `true`, the user's password never expires.<br>
                                      If `false`, the user's password expires.

                                      It is the metadata from LDAP server that determines the unit to which the user belongs to.
                                      This information is mainly used by iManage system administrators.

                                      Indicates the original value of the user ID that is received from the source system such as Active Directory.

                                      It is formatted internally to all upper case letters, and then saved as `id`.
                                      The request fields `id` and `user_id_ex` should be same but the letter case can be different.<br>
                                      For example, if `user_id_ex` is ACase then the `id` will be ACASE.
                                      iManage recommends using `id` when referring to the user.

    description: |
      iManage Work organizes its information in a hierarchical tree structure, similar to many computer operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows.
      This is characterized by folders and documents being contained within other folders. <br><br>

      A folder can contain any number of folders and be structured as required in an organization.
      Folders are also known as containers. A folder created directly under a workspace is called a root-level folder.
      As a best practice, iManage recommends using as few root-level folders as possible to better organize the information.
      A subfolder is any folder that has a parent. The parent can be another folder, a workspace, or a tab.
      Folders have various properties. One of them is called doctype, which defines that the folder is specific to a document type.
      Two doctypes are available by default: Document and Email.
        * When a folder of Document doctype is selected, the display is customized for displaying documents and their properties such as file name, size, and location.
        * When a folder of Email doctype is selected, the display is customized for displaying emails and their properties such as email title, when sent, sender and recipient name, and size.
      Other doctypes can be created and customized by the iManage system administrator.

      Actions applicable for folders include open, add to/remove from My Favorites,  copy link, create new folder, create new shared folder, properties, delete, and upload into a folder.

                    Specifies fields to return in the response JSON.<br><br>
                    Some searches could return many fields, and not all are of interest for the search.
                    Therefore, this request specifies the fields to return.
                    By default, only the `id` and `wstype` fields are included.<br><br>
                    If more fields are needed to be returned, use the parameter `profile_fields` to specify those.
                    The parameter `profile_fields` is not required. If omitted, only the default fields are returned.
                    Items found during the search are still returned even if the search field specifying them is not included in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, the search can specify `owner=acase` but it does not have to include `owner` in the `profile_fields`.<br><br>

                    To return additional fields, specify both the object type and the fields in `profile_fields`.
                    For example, for the following request body specifies returning the `name` and `owner` fields.
                    This is in addition to the two default `id` and `wstype` fields.
                    ```
                    {
                      "filters": { "libraries": "active_us" },
                      "profile_fields": { "workspace": [ "name", "owner"] }
                    }
                    ```
                    The parameter `profile_fields` can contain multiple entries, one for each of the following object types.<br><br>

                    |Type|Description|
                    |:---|:---|
                    |document|A document object.|
                    |email|A document object.|
                    |folder|A folder object.|
                    |workspace|A workspace object.|
                    |user|A user object.|

                    For each object type, specify additional fields.
                    If an object type is included but no objects of that type are returned, that object type entry is ignored.<br>

                    Multiple object types can also be included. The following example specifies the return fields for workspace and email:
                    ```
                    {
                      "profile_fields":
                      {
                        "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ],
                        "email": [ "sender", "title" ]
                      }
                    }
                    ```

                    The parameter `profile_fields` is often combined with the parameter `filters`, which defines the search criteria.
                    The following example returns workspaces that meet the `filters` criteria, and returns the fields `name` and `owner` in the response:
                    ```
                    {
                        "profile_fields":
                        {
                          "workspace": [ "name", "owner" ]
                        },
                        "filters":
                        {

                        }
                    }

        Returns a list of features and capabilities that are supported by the iManage Work system.<br>

        Features and capabilities are special abilities provided directly by the iManage Work system.
        They can vary by iManage Work environment.
        They can also become available after iManage Work product upgrades.

        These special abilities indicate either that specified requests made be called, or a function may be utilized through specified requests.
        The documentation indicates which features or capabilities must be checked for prior to making specified requests, or before attempting to use a special ability.

        Examples include:
        * A request-related special ability is `rate_limited_downloads`.
         If `true`, the request GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{library}/documents/{docId}/rate-limited-download` is available and can be called.
        * A function-related special ability is `document_class_indexable`.
        If `true`, specified requests can invoke document indexing abilities.

        Features can only be known after a user signs in.
        Capabilities can be known before or after a user signs in.

        To check the availability of a feature or capability, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`.
        This returns a list of features and their values.
        * If the value is `true`, the feature or capability is available.
        * If the value is `false`, the feature or capability is not available.
        * If the feature or capability is not present, its default value is indicated in the documentation.

        Attempting to make an unavailable request, or accessing an unavailable function results in an error.

      ### Introduction
      Data encryption is a security measure that prevents visibility of documents in the case of unauthorized access or theft.<br>

      It is also called data at rest encryption, as the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
      In the event they are compromised, either by theft or unauthorized access (including internal unauthorized access), the files will be encrypted, and therefore unreadable.
      When an authorized user accesses documents (such as through being checked out or viewing within the client application), the documents are decrypted and will be able to be read or edited normally.
      When the user is done with them, such as being checked back in, they are encrypted again.

      The enforcement of encryption varies by iManage Work environment.
      For some environments, encryption is automatic and cannot be turned off.
      For other environments, encryption is optional, and not enabled by default.
      In that case, each library must be explicitly enabled for encryption.
      For details, contact your iManage Work system administrator.

      Encryption uses an electronic cipher, called an encryption key.
      Keys are implemented in one of two ways: customer-managed encryption key (CMEK), or a system-managed encryption key.

      ### Customer-managed encryption key
      A customer-managed encryption key allows customers to manage their own encryption keys.
      Customers control their entire process, from generating the customer-supplied encryption key (the source key), to loading the keys into iManage Work, deciding when to use each key, and when to revoke or to replace keys.

      #### Preparation
      Customers must prepare their key for use within iManage Work by performing the following steps:
      1. **Create the source encryption key**<br>
      The customer creates their encryption key.
      This is called the *customer-supplied encryption key* and is the source encryption cipher for rest of the process.
      It is normally an RSA-2048 bit public/private key generated by the tool and security protocols preferred by the customer.

      1. **Create the key stores**<br>
      A key store is a third-party application that securely stores information.
      A common example is Microsoft Azure.
      In a dual-party CMEK system, two separate key stores are required.
      Two customer team members, known as key holders, independently store a copy of the same customer-supplied encryption key in a key store, such as through Microsoft Azure.
      The security advantage is if the two key stores do not contain identical versions of the customer-supplied encryption key, a warning is generated, and these two key stores cannot be used to generate a master key.

      1. **Register the key stores with iManage**<br>
      Each key holder must contact their designated iManage customer service manager (CSM) or their implementation partner, and provide the key store information.
      This allows the customer to pre-authorize the key stores that are permitted for use.
      The security advantage is if the address of a key store being accessed is not the same address that was registered, a warning is generated that a security breach may have been attempted.

      Customers can add new key stores, rename existing keys, or activate their keys without iManage involvement.
      The iManage Work system does not access or modify the key stores for any reason other than to read them.

      #### Creating a master key
      A master key is an encryption key that can be activated on libraries.
      See **Master keys** section for more information.
      After preparing the customer-managed encryption key, a master key can now be created.
      To create the master key, use POST `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys`<br>
      The requester must have the global Key Management privilege.
      The master key is now registered with iManage and is available to be activated on libraries.

      ### System-managed encryption key
      A system-managed encryption key is a built-in master key provided by the iManage Work system.
      This is the default master key and no steps are needed to create it.
      It is a master key that is registered and available to be activated on libraries.

      ### Master keys
      A master key is an encryption key that can be activated on libraries.
      Each library requires a master key to be activated on it for encryption and decryption.
      The following requests are available to manage master keys:
      * To see a list of available master keys, those currently being used and those available to be used, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys`
      * To see details about a specific master key, such as its create date, health, and its current availability, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys/{keyId}`
      * To rename a master key, use PATCH `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys/{keyId}`
      * To see a list of of libraries that a specific master key is assigned to, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/library-keys`

      An available master key can be activated for libraries.
      The following conditions apply:
      * Only one master key can be active for each library.
      * More than one library can use the same master key.
      * More than one master key can be enabled in the system at the same time.
      That means, each library can use a different master key.

      To activate a master key for a library, use POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`<br>
      After a master key is activated for a library, the following occurs:
      * The new master key is immediately activated.
      Encryption with the new master key is immediate.
      * The replaced master key is immediately made inactive.
      The replaced key can be deleted, or archived (it could be reactivated and used again).
      However, iManage recommends as a best practice not to reuse master keys except for the system-managed encryption key.

      ### Library keys
      A library key is a master key that is active on a library.
      Once a library is encrypted, it must always be encrypted.
      A library key can be replaced by activating another master key on it.
      However, a library key cannot simply be deleted.

      To see a list of master keys ever applied for a library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`

      This includes listing the master keys, creating a master key, getting the details of a master key, and renaming a master key.
      To get the correlation between master keys and libraries, see the library keys request collection `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`.<br>

      A master key is a key used to encrypt and decrypt files.
      It is created with POST `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys`.
      This request requires having created two key stores hosting copies of the master key.

      For more information, or for procedures implementing this, see <a href="https://docs.imanage.com/cc-help/10.3.1/en/Encryption_Keys.html" target="_blank">Encryption Keys</a>.<br>
      After the master key is created, it can be activated to start encrypting documents.
      This is done by activating a master key for each library with POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`.

      The following conditions apply:
      * More than one library can use the same master key.
      * More than one master key can be enabled in the system at the same time.
      That means, each library can use a different master key.
      * Only one master key can be active for each library.

      To activate a master key for each library, use POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`
      After a master key is activated for a library, the following occurs:
      * The new master key is immediately activated, making it the new library key.
      Encryption with the new library key is immediate.
      * The previous library key is immediately deactivated.
      It is possible that a library can have more than one inactive library key.

        Registers a master key.<br>

        The global-management privileges required to implement this request: Key Management.<br>

        Registering a master key is a customer-managed encryption key process that validates the two key stores and creates a new master key.
        After the master key is created, the master key is available to be activated on libraries.
        The system-managed encryption key does not need to be created because this system-managed encryption key is always available.

        Before creating a master key, two key stores must be available. Each key store must contain an identical copy of the customer-managed encryption key.
        In creating those vaults, each vault will have:
          * An Azure key vault DNS name. Azure constructs an address to the key vault. For example: `https://www.ajubalaw.vault.azure.net/`.
          This allows the customer to pre-authorize the key vaults that are permitted for use.
          Contact the designated iManage customer service manager (CSM) or implementation partner.
          
          This allows the customer to pre-authorize the vaults that are permitted for use.
          * A key identifier. Also called the Azure Key Version Key Identifier, Azure constructs this address to the master key in the key vault, and uses the Azure key vault DNS name as the base endpoint.
          For example: `https://www.ajubalaw.vault.azure.net/keys/ajubalaw-1/da93550d9b344d04a212dd06b7e7f4dc`
          * An Application ID (also known as a client ID). Azure generates this. It is one of two ID pairings; the other is the Client secret.
          * A Client secret (also known as an application password). Azure generates this. It is one of two ID pairings; the other is the Application ID.

        During the master key creation process, the two key vaults are verified to check if their addresses are accessible, and the keys they contain are identical.
        If successful, the master key is created.
        For more information about any of these values, contact your iManage or network system administrator.<br>

      The library keys request collection correlates the master keys and the libraries they are activated against.
      For more information, see the request collection `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/library-keys`.

      A library key is based off a master key and has been activated or applied to a library.
      To see a list of master keys ever applied for a library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`

      To activate a master key for a library, use POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`
      The system generates a library key out of the master key, and that library key is used for encryption and decryption while it is active.
      Only one library key can be active in the library at any given time.

        Activates a master key for the specified library.

        The minimum access permission required on the library to implement this request: NRTADMIN.

        After a master key is activated for a library, the following occurs:
        * The new master key is immediately activated, making it the new library key.
        Encryption with the new library key is immediate.
        * The previous library key is immediately deactivated.
        It is possible that a library can have more than one inactive library key.

    description: |
      Documents are the files used to record the internal and client information of an organization. 

      In iManage Work, the documents are configurable items and can be of almost any file type such as text, graphics, video, or a proprietary format such as Microsoft Word (.doc, and .docx)
      and Adobe PDF. Documents have properties associated with them, and the set of its properties is referred to document profile.

      Actions available for documents in iManage Work include check in/check out, where used, preview, download, upload new version,
      add to/remove from My Favorites, copy link, share (as link, as document, or both, as secure link), copy to share folder, move,
      delete, see properties, declare/undeclare as record, relate to another document, lock/unlock, and view timeline. 

      Following are some of the properties of a document:
      - Document owner. Also called an author, this is the user who created or imported the document.
      - Document operator. This ss the user who last modified (edited, created, or renamed) a document.
      - Document number. This is number assigned at the time the document is created or first loaded into iManage system. This number is unique for
        a specific library.
      - Document version number. This indicates the current version, or the number of times the document has been edited or modified.
      - Document ID. This uniquely identifies the document. The document ID is a combination of the library name, the document number separated by an exclamation mark, and the document version number.
        For example, for *active_us436025.2*, active_us is the library name, 436025 is the document number and 2 indicates the second version of document.

          It is possible to specify `results=false` and no valid facets parameters.
          In this case, no data of either type is returned although a valid but empty JSON object is returned.

        The customer ID assigned to the customer.<br><br>
        The customer ID can be found in the discovery request GET `https://{hostname}/api`.
        The returned JSON field **data > user > customer_id** contains the customer ID.
        This unique value is permanently assigned to the iManage Work system and needs to be checked only once when the application first runs each time.

      The directory sync APIs support bulk import of global users and groups for the customers into iManage Work system.<br><br>
      The directory sync runs regularly per the configured sync-schedule for the customer's directory-sync client application.
      During each such sync, only the affected records are added, updated, or disabled.<br>

      The directory sync client application first fetches hashes for all the Microsoft Active Directory users, groups, and group memberships from iManage.
      The hashes are encrypted values for the original user and group profile data. Then it calculates hashes for users, groups,
      and group memberships based on the current information in the customer’s identity provider (IDP) and the client application’s configuration.
      The directory sync client then compares the calculated hashes to the ones it retrieved from iManage in order to determine which users,
      groups, and group memberships need to be added, updated, or disabled. After determining the changes, it sends updates only for
      the affected users, groups, and group memberships to iManage Work.

      description: |
        Returns a list of custom property aliases that had recent activity.<br><br>
        The list is returned in descending order of the last activity date.<br>

        An alias is an entry for a custom property.
        For example, custom1 is captioned as Client.
        It has three entries of 001, 001abc, 001643, and 001HT76.
        Each of the entries is an alias, also referred to as an alias of Client.<br>

        For example, the following returns a list of aliases for custom1 that had any activity within the last three days:<br>
        GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/customs/custom1/recent?since_days=3`<br>
        and would return a response like:
        ```
        {
          "data": [
            {
              "activity_date": "2020-03-25T02:24:04Z",
              "database": "active",
              "description": "Pending cases",
              "enabled": true,
              "hipaa": true,
              "id": "001643",
              "wstype": "custom1"
            },
            {
              "activity_date": "2020-03-24T21:44:11Z",
              "database": "active",
              "description": "Purchase agreements",

              "id": "001abc",
              "wstype": "custom1"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        The property pairings of Custom1/Custom2 and Custom29/Custom30 have a parent/child relationship
        That means each alias of custom1 and custom29 can themselves have aliases.
        Responses including custom2 and custom30 have an additional field, that of the parent ID.<br>

        For example, the following returns a list of aliases for custom2 that had any activity within the last ten days:<br>
        GET `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/customs/custom2/recent?activity_date=-10:0d`<br>

      summary: Get custom metadata of a specified customer
      description: |-
        Gets the custom variables that have been updated since the last sync, specified using the `edit_date_from` parameter.

        Note that this request accepts `customPropertyId` values `custom1` through `custom31` with no restrictions. Generally, `custom1` is used for clients, `custom2` for matters, and in the event that different properties are used to represent client and matter, this API can still be used to get the desired information.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Important to know</font><br>
        Specifying the `edit_date_from` parameter in the same request the `cursor` parameter will result in an error response.

        <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Required authorization</font><br>
        This endpoint can be accessed by
        * Any user with NRTAdmin
        * A system user that is listed on an internal list of users that have read permission to sync data about trustees.

            For example, if `user_id_ex` is ACase then the `id` will be ACASE.
            iManage recommends using `id` when referring to the user.

            The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
            It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

            During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
            If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
            If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
            If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

            Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

            Data encryption is a security measure that prevents visibility of documents in the case of unauthorized access or theft.
            Also called *data at rest encryption*, the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
            This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive information from accidental or wrongful disclosure.

            Indicates the value of the document's checksum.

            The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
            It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

            During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
            If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
            If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
            If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

            Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

            Data encryption is a security measure that prevents visibility of documents in the case of unauthorized access or theft.
            Also called *data at rest encryption*, the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
            This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive information from accidental or wrongful disclosure.

            Indicates the value of the document's checksum.

            The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
            It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

            During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
            If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
            If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
            If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

            Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

        Effective security is the access level that is the net result of a combination of the following:

        * a user's access permission for that object
        * possible conflicts among groups to which the user belongs to
        * the security model being used.

        The available access levels are:

        |Access level|Description|
        |:---|:---|
        |no_access|The user has no access, or any permissions to the container or document.|
        |read|The user can access the container, or read the document but cannot add or remove items from the container unless explicitly assigned access permission.|
        |read_write|The user can access the container, or read and edit a document unless explicitly excluded.|
        |full_access|The user has complete access to the container or document, and may read, edit, or delete the item. The user may grant permissions to other users and groups, and can edit the item's default security levels.|

            The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
            It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

            During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
            If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
            If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
            If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

            Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

            The document type is used by the iManage Work system to associate the document to an application.
            For example: WORD for Microsoft Word.

            Indicates the version number of the target document.<br><br>
            The document version number is number of times the document has been edited and is the numeric end portion of the document ID.
            For example, the version number of document active_uk!7483.3 is 3.
          example: 3

            * a user's access permission for that object
            * possible conflicts among groups to which the user belongs to
            * the security model being used.

            The available access levels are:

            |Access level|Description|
            |:---|:---|
            |no_access|The user has no access, or any permissions to the container or document.|
            |read|The user can access the container, or read the document but cannot add or remove items from the container unless explicitly assigned access permission.|
            |read_write|The user can access the container, or read and edit a document unless explicitly excluded.|

            If `true`, the document is encrypted.<br>
            If `false`, the document is not encrypted.

            Data encryption is a security measure that prevents visibility of documents in the case of unauthorized access or theft.
            Also called *data at rest encryption*, the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
            This encryption is compliant to HIPAA and other American statutes protecting sensitive information from accidental or wrongful disclosure.

            Document number is the number assigned to a document when it is imported to iManage Work,
            and appears as part of the document ID.<br>
            Document ID is the combination of library ID, document number, and document version.<br>
            For example, if library ID is ACTIVE_UK, document number is 72634, and document version is 3, then document ID is `ACTIVE_UK!72634.3`.

        checksum:
          type: string
          description: |
            Indicates the value of the document's checksum.

            The document checksum is a calculated value based the document's content.
            It is used to verify the integrity of a document content during transfer.

            During a file upload, the checksum of the content is calculated and saved along with the document profile.
            If the document profile in the request has a checksum value, it is compared with the newly generated checksum.
            If the checksum values do not match, the request fails.
            If the document profile in the request does not include checksum property, the comparison is not performed.

            Only the SHA256 checksum type is supported. For example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1
          example: SHA256:FF4085AD157354DC8EA67A848E7C2270B4A19282713CF3A7ECF8E0FFBB159ED1

        * a user's access permission for that object
        * possible conflicts among groups to which the user belongs to
        * the security model being used.

        The available access levels are:

        |Access level|Description|
        |:---|:---|
        |no_access|The user has no access, or any permissions to the container or document.|
        |read|The user can access the container, or read the document but cannot add or remove items from the container unless explicitly assigned access permission.|
        |read_write|The user can access the container, or read and edit a document unless explicitly excluded.|
        |full_access|The user has complete access to the container or document, and may read, edit, or delete the item. The user may grant permissions to other users and groups, and can edit the item's default security levels.|

- name: External Authentication Types
  description: |+
    An external authentication type is a **claims-based** authentication type (for example, SAML).
    Claims-based authentication validates the identity of the user against the desired identity provider. 
    This allows administrators to provide identification using multiple options, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). 
    One of the biggest benefits of using claims-based authentication is that iManage Work clients and Work Server do not have to be on the same domain. 
    The External Authentication API provides the ability to configure the routing of user authentication to external identity providers.

- name: Apps
  description: |-
    Applications (also called apps) are software packages that either integrate with iManage Work to access data from it, or extend the functionality of iManage Work client applications.
    For example, a firm may use an application for document comparison.
    The application can extend iManage Work functionality by adding a context menu to documents for document comparison.
    Each app is identified by the client ID associated with it.

    These applications are either developed by iManage, third-party vendors, or a company's internal development staff.

    Types of apps:
      * iManage apps - These applications are available for iManage Work client applications.
        For example, iManage Work Desktop for Windows, iManage Work Email Management for Gmail, iManage Work Desktop for Mac, and Mobility for iOS.

      * Third-party apps:
        * Standalone applications that interact with iManage Work through APIs only to access information and do not modify the iManage Work user interface.
          For example, an application that tracks and analyzes audit records of documents in iManage Work to understand user behavior.
        * Applications that extend iManage features and modify the user interface by providing context menus or new panels in the following applications:
          * iManage Work
          * iManage Work Desktop for Windows
          * iManage Control Center

    Not all apps are available to all users. The users are assigned to apps by the iManage system administrator.

- name: Dialog Tokens
  description: |-
    A dialog token is a temporary access token used by the partner application to communicate with iManage Work dialogs within iframes.

    An iManage Work system requires each API request to be authenticated. In an iManage desktop or web client, this is handled by retaining
    the access token (X-Auth-Token), and passing it with each call. The server validates the token and accepts or rejects it appropriately.

    However, in an independent partner web application, passing the access token is not as convenient and presents a security issue.
    In the partner web application, iManage dialogs are launched within an iframe. Once the partner application completes the OAuth2
    process and retrieves a valid X-Auth-Token, it needs to communicate this token to the dialog embedded within the iframe.
    This is challenging as it presents a security issue. To solve this issue, the workflow requires the partner application to retrieve
    a one-time dialog token using the retrieved X-Auth-Token and communicating this dialog token over to the dialog iframe.
    This dialog token is a temporary access token. It is created by iManage Work and is associated with the application when it is needed,
    and has a short lifespan of few seconds. The server then validates the dialog token with the x-auth-token,
    and accepts or rejects it appropriately.

- name: Directory Sync Groups and Users
  description: |-
    The directory sync APIs support bulk import of users and groups for the customers into iManage Work system.
    The directory sync runs regularly per the configured sync-schedule for the customer's directory-sync client application.
    During each such sync, only the affected records are added, updated, or disabled.

    The directory sync client application first fetches hashes for all the AD users, groups, and group memberships from iManage.
    The hashes are encrypted values for the original user and group profile data. Then it calculates hashes for users, groups,
    and group memberships based on the current information in the customer’s identity provider (IDP) and the client application’s configuration.
    The directory sync client then compares the calculated hashes to the ones it retrieved from iManage in order to determine which users,
    groups, and group memberships need to be added, updated, or disabled. After determining the changes, it sends updates only for
    the affected users, groups, and group memberships to iManage Work.

- name: Encryption
  description: |
    ### Introduction
    Data encryption is a security measure that prevents visibility of documents in the case of unauthorized access or theft.<br>

    It is also called data at rest encryption, as the data files are encrypted when they are not being used.
    In the event they are compromised, either by theft or unauthorized access (including internal unauthorized access), the files will be encrypted, and therefore unreadable.
    When an authorized user accesses documents (such as through being checked out or viewing within the client application), the documents are decrypted and will be able to be read or edited normally.
    When the user is done with them, such as being checked back in, they are encrypted again.

    The enforcement of encryption varies by iManage Work environment.
    For some environments, encryption is automatic and cannot be turned off.
    For other environments, encryption is optional, and not enabled by default.
    In that case, each library must be explicitly enabled for encryption.
    For details, contact your iManage Work system administrator.

    Encryption uses an electronic cipher, called an encryption key.
    Keys are implemented in one of two ways: customer-managed encryption key (CMEK), or a system-managed encryption key.

    ### Customer-managed encryption key
    A customer-managed encryption key allows customers to manage their own encryption keys.
    Customers control their entire process, from generating the customer-supplied encryption key (the source key), to loading the keys into iManage Work, deciding when to use each key, and when to revoke or to replace keys.

    #### Preparation
    Customers must prepare their key for use within iManage Work by performing the following steps:
    1. **Create the source encryption key**<br>
    The customer creates their encryption key.
    This is called the *customer-supplied encryption key* and is the source encryption cipher for rest of the process.
    It is normally an RSA-2048 bit public/private key generated by the tool and security protocols preferred by the customer.

    1. **Create the key stores**<br>
    A key store is a third-party application that securely stores information.
    A common example is Microsoft Azure.
    In a dual-party CMEK system, two separate key stores are required.
    Two customer team members, known as key holders, independently store a copy of the same customer-supplied encryption key in a key store, such as through Microsoft Azure.
    The security advantage is if the two key stores do not contain identical versions of the customer-supplied encryption key, a warning is generated, and these two key stores cannot be used to generate a master key.

    1. **Register the key stores with iManage**<br>
    Each key holder must contact their designated iManage customer service manager (CSM) or their implementation partner, and provide the key store information.
    This allows the customer to pre-authorize the key stores that are permitted for use.
    The security advantage is if the address of a key store being accessed is not the same address that was registered, a warning is generated that a security breach may have been attempted.

    Customers can add new key stores, rename existing keys, or activate their keys without iManage involvement.
    The iManage Work system does not access or modify the key stores for any reason other than to read them.

    #### Creating a master key
    A master key is an encryption key that can be activated on libraries.
    See **Master keys** section for more information.
    After preparing the customer-managed encryption key, a master key can now be created.
    To create the master key, use POST `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys`<br>
    The requester must have the global Key Management privilege.
    The master key is now registered with iManage and is available to be activated on libraries.

    ### System-managed encryption key
    A system-managed encryption key is a built-in master key provided by the iManage Work system.
    This is the default master key and no steps are needed to create it.
    It is a master key that is registered and available to be activated on libraries.

    ### Master keys
    A master key is an encryption key that can be activated on libraries.
    Each library requires a master key to be activated on it for encryption and decryption.
    The following requests are available to manage master keys:
    * To see a list of available master keys, those currently being used and those available to be used, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys`
    * To see details about a specific master key, such as its create date, health, and its current availability, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys/{keyId}`
    * To rename a master key, use PATCH `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/master-keys/{keyId}`
    * To see a list of of libraries that a specific master key is assigned to, use GET `/customers/{customerId}/encryption/library-keys`

    An available master key can be activated for libraries.
    The following conditions apply:
    * Only one master key can be active for each library.
    * More than one library can use the same master key.
    * More than one master key can be enabled in the system at the same time.
    That means, each library can use a different master key.

    To activate a master key for a library, use POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`<br>
    After a master key is activated for a library, the following occurs:
    * The new master key is immediately activated.
    Encryption with the new master key is immediate.
    * The replaced master key is immediately made inactive.
    The replaced key can be deleted, or archived (it could be reactivated and used again).
    However, iManage recommends as a best practice not to reuse master keys except for the system-managed encryption key.

    ### Library keys
    A library key is a master key that is active on a library.
    Once a library is encrypted, it must always be encrypted.
    A library key can be replaced by activating another master key on it.
    However, a library key cannot simply be deleted.

    To see a list of master keys ever applied for a library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/encryption/keys`

- name: Global Groups
  description: |+
    A group defines a set of users. Global groups are intended for managing access to applications.
    A global group can be added to an application's access control list.
    This provides access to the application to all the members of the group
    For information on applications, see <a href="#tag--Apps">Apps</a>.

    Global groups are created and managed independently of any iManage Work library. These groups are independent of the library level groups.
    Unlike library-level groups, global groups cannot be used for managing container or document security.
    For information on library-level groups, see <a href="#tag--Library-Groups">Library Groups</a>.

    **Important information about global groups:**
    * Groups can be maintained by adding or removing users.
    * A user can be a member of multiple global groups.
    * A user can be added to any global group, regardless of the libraries they have been assigned to.
    * Once a group is created, it cannot be deleted. However, it can be disabled if required.

- name: Global Roles
  description: |
    iManage Work uses role-based access to achieve fine levels of granularity controlling features for users.
    Each user's ability to perform actions in iManage Work is based on their collection of allowed and denied abilities.
    This is accomplished through two mechanisms: Privileges and roles.

    <font style="color:black;font-size: 17px;font-weight: bold;">Privileges</font><br>
    A privilege is a permission to perform a set of tasks.
    * The iManage Work system defines several privileges. The privileges are defined by the system and cannot be created or deleted.
      They can be only granted or denied.
      For example, privileges may or may not be available for individual users the ability to manage users and groups, or to change system settings.
    * A privilege cannot be directly assigned to a user.
      A role must be created with the set of privileges and then the role can be assigned to a user.
    * Privileges apply to both iManage Work system administrators and other users.
      For example, a system administrator may be denied the privilege of making encryption changes, while a regular user could have that privilege.

    For more information, see <a href="#overview--privileges"> Privileges</a>.

    <font style="color:black;font-size: 17px;font-weight: bold;">Roles</font><br>
    A role is a named set of privileges. Roles may be created or deleted as required.<br>

    <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Use of roles</font><br>
    The privileges available to a user are defined by their job in the company.
    For example, developers will need a different combination of privileges than an accountant, or a marketing team member.
    This allows the fine granularity of responsibilities, and can distribute access selectively across an organization.

    <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Scope of roles</font><br>
    Roles are defined at two levels: **Global** and **Library**.

    * **Global roles**<br>
    Global roles affect iManage Work at a global level, or independently of any libraries.
    There is no default global role and it is not mandatory to assign a global role to a user.
    However, a user can have none, one, or more global roles.
    If there is a privilege conflict by a user having two or more global roles, the most permissive privilege takes precedence.
    For example, if a user is assigned to a global role that provides access to Settings Management privilege, and another global
    role that denies Settings Management, the net effect is that the user gets Settings Management privilege. <br><br>
    Each role contains all the privileges and each individual privilege can be marked as the following:

        | Access Levels | Description                                            |
        |---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
        | admin         | Provides administrative level access to the privilege. |
        | no_access     | Provides no access to the privilege.                   |

      * **Global role privileges**<br>
        For global roles, the following is the set of privileges currently available in iManage system:
          * **App Management**: Specifies a user's ability to manage applications. For example, they can add internal or external applications.
          * **Group Management**: Specifies a user's ability to manage global groups. For example, they can create global groups, rename groups, and add users to groups.
          * **Feature Management**: Specifies a user's ability to manage upcoming features. This privilege allows users to enable and disable new upcoming features, before they become permanent in the system.
          * **Key Management**: Specifies a user's ability to manage encryption keys. This allows users to manage encryption keys, such as registering a new key, or activating a key on a library.
          * **Role Management**: Specifies a user's ability to  manage global roles. For example, they can create global roles, delete roles, and edit roles.
          * **Settings Management**: Specifies a user's ability to manage iManage Work global settings. For example, they can manage iManage Work global settings, and settings for iOS, iManage Work Desktop for Windows, and iManage Work classic clients.
          * **User Management**: Specifies a user's ability to manage global settings of users. For example, they can create virtual users, edit user profile and security, reset password, and enable or disable sign-in.

      * **Role Management privilege**<br>
        A user with Role Management privilege can create new roles, edit roles, change the role of other users, and delete roles.
        To administer global roles of other users, a user must be assigned to a role that has the Role Management privilege.
        Therefore, the Role Management privilege must be assigned to users diligently.

    * **Library roles**<br>
    Library roles are the users' role within an individual iManage Work library.
    They can provide iManage Work object level privileges such a being able to create new documents, edit documents, create public folders, and so on.<br>
    For more information, see the <a href="#tag--Library-Roles">Library Roles</a> collection.

- name: Users
  description: |2-
      A user is the basic entity that utilizes iManage Work applications. <br>
      A user can be an individual person that accesses iManage Work applications or a service account that performs automated tasks.
      Users can be created manually in iManage Work or imported from a directory service such as Microsoft Windows’ active domain.<br>
      The iManage Work system administrator assigns roles to these users, adds users to groups, and optionally applies access rights to individual users when their default access rights need to be modified.

      Users in iManage Work can be categorized in two ways based on how they are managed and created.

      Based on how the users are managed in iManage Work:
      * **Global users** - Global users are created and managed independent of any iManage Work library. The changes to a user's profile or settings are updated at a global level.
      For example, disabling user's login or changing the preferred library.
      * **Library users** - Each iManage library has its own list of subscribed users. A user must be subscribed to each library individually by an iManage Work system administrator to provide access to a library.
      A user can be subscribed only to certain libraries and prevented from accessing content of other libraries.

      Based on how the users are created in iManage Work:
      * **Virtual users** - The users are created and managed in iManage Work. The virtual users are authenticated against passwords stored in iManage Work. They are not part of the organization's directory service.
        These are typically external users who are not part of the organization and are included for a specific purpose and for a defined period of time. For example, auditors, interns, and contractors.
        This user is created at the global level, and must be manually assigned to a library. A virtual user can be converted to an enterprise user by changing their user type (`nos`) value from 2 to 6.
      * **Enterprise users** - The users that are added to iManage Work from the organization's directory service. The enterprise users are authenticated against the IDP configured
        by an organization. Virtual users can be synced with the organization's directory service and converted to enterprise users by changing their user type (`nos`) value from 6 to 2.

    The Asynchronous Task Framework is designed to perform the asynchronous tasks that require an extended period of time to complete and can run in as a background process.
    This framework can be used by iManage applications to support updates on large data sets without blocking users. It also provides options to monitor
    the tasks to iManage system administrators.

    This framework is designed for tasks that:
    * are asynchronous.
    * perform bulk operations.
    * take longer time to complete.
    * are not transactional.

    A few examples of asynchronous tasks are:
    * Copying of files from one location to another.
    * Bulk security update of documents and containers.
    * Deleting documents and all data related to them.

  x-tag-expanded: false

- name: Captions
  description: |-
    A caption is a customized label.

    iManage Work provides more than a hundred labels to assist with localizing the environment and for cataloging documents.
    The system provides all label sets in seven languages.
    Only one set is used, specified by the preferred language.
    Each label can be renamed to allow it be customization for the organization.
    A caption is the customized label.

    Some labels are descriptive and are not often changed by the organization, such as Name, Author, or EditDate.
    Other labels are meant to be customized.
    Notably, these are the labels for the custom1 through custom30 fields.
    These labels form the basis of cataloging and identifying containers and documents.
    For example, custom1 is often captioned as Client, and custom2 as Matter.
    Each organization can use captions appropriate to their needs.

    Regardless of the actual captions, some labels and captions are used throughout some applications, notably for convenience.
    For REST APIs, request parameters will always use `custom1`, for example, regardless what it has been captioned to.
    On the other hand, the client has a container named My Matters, referring to custom2 items, even if custom2 captioned as *Project*.

    **Captions and aliases**<br>
    Captions and aliases are closely related, and the differences are often confusing.

    Captions:<br>
    A caption is an identifier of a property.<br>
    * An *id* is the default name of the property.
    For example, *custom1* and *author* are ids.
    The id cannot be changed,
    * A *label* is a name assigned to caption id.
    For example, the id *custom1* can be captioned to the label *Client*.
    That means, a *caption* is the `label`.
    Labels can be customized for the organizations requirements.

    Aliases:<br>
    * An *alias* is an individual entry in a custom field.
    Each custom property custom1 through custom30 is a category that contain lists of items.
    Each individual item is an alias.
    For example, an organization may intend that the custom field *Client* contains a list of their clients, perhaps Microsoft, Enron, and Peter's Bread Company.
    That means Client has three aliases.

    However, to refer to custom properties in a consistent way, the id is used even if it has a caption.
    For example, a client application, its documentation, or help may always refer *custom1* although it might be captioned as *Client*.
    Even among different organizations using different captions, custom1 will always refers to the same property.

    or a proprietary format such as Microsoft Word (.doc, and .docx)
    and Adobe PDF. Documents have properties associated with them, and the set of its properties is referred to as the document profile.

    The most common actions that can be performed on iManage Work documents are as follows:
    * check-in or check-out
    * preview
    * download
    * upload new version
    * add to or remove from My Favorites
    * copy link and share (as link, as document, or both, as secure link)
    * copy to share folder
    * move and delete
    * declare or undeclare as record
    * relate to another document
    * lock or unlock
    * view document timeline

    Important information about documents:
    - Document owner, also called an author, is the user who created or imported the document.
    - Document operator is the user who last modified (edited, created, or renamed) a document.
    - Document number is assigned at the time the document is created or first loaded into an iManage system. This number is unique for
      a specific library.
    - Document version number indicates the current version, or the number of times the document has been edited or modified.
    - Document ID uniquely identifies the document. The document ID is a combination of the library name and the document number separated by an exclamation mark.
      For example, active_us!436025.2 where active_us is library name, 436025 is document number and 2 indicates the second version of document.

    such as Microsoft Word documents .docx, Excel spreadsheets .xlsx, along with less common document types, and even custom document types,
    such as a format proprietary to the organization.

    To associate a document type to an application that can read it, two resources work together: File types, and file handlers.

    File types define lists of types of documents based on their application extension. That is the documents suffix such as Microsoft Word documents of .docx, or Adobe Acrobat documents of .pdf.

    File handlers define lists of applications that can open specified file types. This ties an application, such as Microsoft Word to a file type such as .docx.
    For example, after the file type and file handler is defined, selecting a .docx document within iManage Work displays that document in the preview window.

      iManage Work organizes its content in a hierarchical container tree structure, similar to many computer operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows.
      In iManage Work, the tree structure is formed by two types of containers: Workspaces and Folders.
      * A workspace is a root-level container that can only be created at the library level. A workspace can contain only folders and tabs,
        but not documents or other workspaces.
      * A folder is created under a workspace or any other folder. It can contain subfolders and documents. A folder may contain any number of
        subfolders and be structured as needed. A folder created directly under a workspace is called a root-level folder. <br>
        Each folder is assigned with a container ID which is a combination of its library name and a number. For example: active_uk!4532.

      The Folders collection includes requests to list folders, create folders, delete folders, modify profile properties and security,
      search for folders, and create subfolders.

- name: Forms
  description: |-
    The Forms collection manages property forms and search forms.<br>

    A property form is a set of property fields assigned to an iManage Work object type, such as workspaces and documents.
    This is also known as the object profile.
    Each instance of that iManage Work object type will have the same set of property fields.<br>
    A search form is the set of property fields assigned to an iManage Work search object.
    Users can select only from that set for a search.<br>

    This ensures that all instances of that object type (such as all documents) have the same set of properties.
    An organization can customize object types by selecting a specific set of property fields.
    This allows them to better classify those object types and to more effectively search for them.<br>

    The following items have forms:
      * workspaces
      * folders and tabs
      * documents and emails
      * document and email search
      * workspace search

    Three forms are for object types: Workspaces, folders and tabs, and documents and emails.
    These forms are defined by assigning property fields from their object models.<br>

    A user can see the document profile by opening any document from an iManage Work client, and select the Properties tab.
    The document profile fields display as properties of that document in the Properties tab.<br>

    For example, a document's object model may have more than 20 property fields.
    It is from these property fields that the object profile gets defined from.
    Some property fields are required. A document profile must have a name, size, location, and author, among others.
    Some fields are optional.
    An organization, for example, may decide their documents only need custom1 and custom2 property fields but not custom3.<br>

    Two forms are searches: Document and email searches, and workspace searches.
    The property fields assigned to these are the set of properties that may be used as criteria for a search.
    These can be seen iManage Work clients during a search.
    For example:
     1. In an iManage Work client, select Recent documents, and select a search in the search bar.
     1. The criteria presented in the basic search are a few fields from the document profile.
     1. Select **Advanced Search**. The search criteria includes all the document profile fields.

    <font style="color:black;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;">Using forms request</font><br>
    To see the set of currently assigned fields to an object type's property set:
     * Use the request GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/forms/{formType}`
       If the item is a custom property, the uncaptioned custom property name is shown, such as  *custom1*, or *custom2*, and not the captioned version, such as *Client* or *Matter*.
     * In iManage Control Center, see **Settings&nbsp;>&nbsp;Forms**.

    There are default sets of property fields for each object type.
    These are sets of property fields defined at the time of iManage Work installation.
    To see the set of default fields, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/forms/{formType}/default`
    For example, a document and email object have the following default fields: Name, document_number, version, author, operator, class, subclass, type, size, comments, edit_date, create_date, last_user, status/checked_out, checkout location, where used, related documents, Default Security, custom1, custom2, custom13, custom14, custom15, custom16, custom21, and custom22.

    Object profiles may currently have a different set of properties if the profile had been changed after the initial installation.

    An object profile set may be customized.
    That is, property fields may be added, updated, or deleted.
    Each object type (such as workspace or document) has system-defined set of property fields that may be added, and only those available may be used.<br>
    The see the list of available fields, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/forms/{formType}/available-fields`

    To add or delete a property from an object, see PUT `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/forms/{formType}`
    To add a property field, include it in the request body. To remove a property, do not include it in the request body.
    Like any PUT call, the properties in the request body completely replace the existing set of property fields.
    Therefore, care must be taken to make sure this body list is complete and is what is intended that the object type should have.<br>

    To see the current set of active property fields, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/forms/visible-fields`

- name: KM Tags
  description: |-
    Some of the organizations need to manage documents under knowledge libraries. These documents form the knowledge
    management system of an organization. The documents are tagged with the knowledge management tags (KM tags)
    to allow the users to classify the documents in a specific way that is meaningful to them, and to organize and filter the content.
    The KM tags are extended metadata values set on iManage Work objects.
    These are similar to name-value pair properties. However, they are single value tags without any names.
    The KM tags can be created for documents, and containers such as folders, workspaces, and categories.

    This feature may not be available for all environments.
    Prior to executing the KM tag requests, check GET `/customers/{customerId}/features`.<br>
    If `km_tags` is `true`, this feature is available.

- name: Library Directory Sync Groups and Users
  description: |-
    The directory sync APIs support bulk import of users and groups for the customers into iManage Work system.
    The directory sync runs regularly per the configured sync-schedule for the customer's directory-sync client application.
    During each such sync, only the affected records are added, updated, or disabled.

    The directory sync client application first fetches hashes for all the AD users, groups, and group memberships from iManage.
    The hashes are encrypted values for the original user and group profile data. Then it calculates hashes for users, groups,
    and group memberships based on the current information in the customer’s identity provider (IDP) and the client application’s configuration.
    The directory sync client then compares the calculated hashes to the ones it retrieved from iManage in order to determine which users,
    groups, and group memberships need to be added, updated, or disabled. After determining the changes, it sends updates only for
    the affected users, groups, and group memberships to iManage Work.
  x-tag-expanded: false

- name: Library Groups
  description: |
    Library groups are collections of multiple users within a library who are intended to have identical access permission to containers and documents.
    Groups can be assigned the access permissions to iManage Work objects. This provides all members of the group the same access level to the target iManage Work object.

    For example, a group can be created for contractors. This group can then be granted read-only access to certain workspaces.

    For more information on types of groups, see <a href="#overview--types-of-groups"> Types of groups</a>.

    **Important information about library groups:**
    * Groups are intended for controlling access to iManage Work objects for multiple users simultaneously.
      Modifying a group's access to an object affects all the members of the group at once.
      This is more convenient than managing access to objects for individual users.
    * Groups can be maintained by adding or removing users.
    * Once a group is created, it cannot be deleted. However, a group can be disabled if it is no longer needed.
    * A user can be a member of multiple groups.
    * If a user is a member of multiple library groups, and these groups are given different levels of access to the same object,
      then the highest access level takes precedence.
    * If a user is a member of a group that has been given some level of access to an object, and the user is individually given a different access level to the same object,
      then the highest of these two access levels takes precedence for the user.
    * The NRTADMIN group is available in iManage Work automatically, and it need not be created. Any user assigned to the NRTADMIN group
      becomes by definition an NRTADMIN, regardless of their current role. A user who is removed from the NRTADMIN group retains
      the role they previously had. Only another NRTADMIN is allowed to add or remove users from a group.
    * Members of the NRTADMIN group have complete administrative rights. This group is intended only for iManage Work system administrators.
    * Groups can be created and modified as required, with the exception of the NRTADMIN group.
    * When users are added to a group, they gain access to all the iManage Work objects that the group has access to, with the same levels.
      Similarly, users are removed from a group, they lose that access.
  x-tag-expanded: false

- name: Library Roles
  description: |
    iManage Work uses role-based access to achieve fine levels of granularity controlling features for users.
    Each user's ability to perform actions in iManage Work is based on their collection of allowed and denied abilities.
    This is accomplished through two mechanisms: Privileges and roles.

    For more information, see <a href="#overview--privileges"> Privileges</a> and <a href="#tag--Global-Roles"> Global roles</a>.

    **Library roles**<br>
    Library roles are user roles within an individual iManage Work library.
    They provide iManage Work object level privileges such a being able to create new documents, edit documents, create public folders, and so on.
    They also provide privilege to create custom lookup values, manage users and groups, manage roles of other users, and so on.
    * A user always has only one library role. If a library role is not explicitly assigned,
    the user is automatically assigned to either the DEFAULT or DEFAULT_EXTERNAL role,
    based on whether they have been defined as an internal or external user in their user profile.
    * The DEFAULT and DEFAULT_EXTERNAL roles cannot be deleted.
    These are permanent roles used as the default if a user is not assigned to any role.
    * A user can only be assigned to one library role at any time.

    **Categorization of roles based on bit masks**

    The library level role privileges are classified under the following bit masks:<br>

    | Bit mask | Description                                   |
    |----------|-----------------------------------------------|
    | m1_bits  | Role privileges for document and folder operations. These define a user's ability to check out documents, create public folders, delete documents and folders, and so on. |
    | m2_bits  | Role privileges for using administrative tools. These define a user's ability to use iManage Work tools such as Administration tool, Import tool, and so on.|
    | m3_bits  | Role privileges for web page operations. These define a user's ability to create workspaces, search for workspaces, create templates, and so on.|
    | m4_bits  | Role privileges for iManage Control Center administrative operations. These define a user's ability to manage other users and library groups, govern security management settings, and so on.|

    **Categorization of administrative roles**

    The administrative library roles are categorized under tiers (Tier 1 and Tier 2) that have predefined sets of privileges. <br>
    Other than these tiers, members of the library-level NRTADMIN group have additional privileges. For more information on the NRTADMIN group, see <a href="#tag--Library-Groups">Library Groups</a>.<br>

    For more information on the following role privileges, see the response section of the request <a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/libraries/-libraryId-/roles"> Get library roles</a>.

    | Tier 1             | Tier 2                     | NRTADMIN group             |
    |--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
    | content_assistance | Tier 1 privileges          | Tier 2 privileges          |
    | trustee_assistance | system_metadata_management | govern_security_management |
    |                    | app_settings_management    | role_management            |
    |                    | report                     | system_management          |
    |                    | report_management          | trustee_management         |
    |                    | custom_metadata_management |                            |
    |                    | dms_job_operation          |                            |


    **Role Management privilege**<br>
    A user with the Role Management privilege can create new roles, edit roles, change the role of other users, and delete roles at library level.
    To administer library roles of other users, a user must be assigned to a role that has the Role Management privilege.
    Therefore, the Role Management privilege must be assigned to users diligently.
  x-tag-expanded: false

- name: Library Users
  description: |2
      A user is the basic entity that utilizes iManage Work applications. <br>
      A user can be an individual person that accesses iManage Work applications or a service account that performs automated tasks.
      Users can be created manually in iManage Work or imported from a directory service such as Microsoft Active Directory.<br>
      The iManage Work system administrator assigns roles to these users, adds users to groups, and optionally applies access
      rights to individual users when their default access rights need to be modified.

      Users in iManage Work can be created at two levels based on the environment:

      * **Global level** <br>
      If the <a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/features"> feature flag</a> `global_users` is `true` for your environment,
      then a user is created at the global level using the request
      <a href="#post-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/users">POST `/customers/{customerId}/users`</a>.<br>
      A user can then be assigned to a library by an iManage Work system administrator to provide access to it.
      A user can be assigned to more than one library. For more information, see <a href="#tag--Users">Users</a>.

      * **Library level** <br>
      If the <a href="#get-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/features"> feature flag</a> `global_users` is `false` for your environment,
      then a user is created at the library level using the request
      <a href="#post-/work/api/v2/customers/-customerId-/libraries/-libraryId-/users">POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/users`</a>.<br>
      A user is created and directly assigned to the library.

      The following types of users can be created in iManage Work:
      * **Virtual users** - The users are created and managed in iManage Work. The virtual users are authenticated against passwords stored in iManage Work. They are not part of the organization's directory service.
          These are typically external users who are not part of the organization and are included for a specific purpose and for a defined period of time. For example, auditors, interns, and contractors.
          This user is created at the global level, and must be manually assigned to a library. A virtual user can be converted to an enterprise user by changing their user type (`nos`) value from 2 to 6.
      * **Enterprise users** - The users that are added to iManage Work from the organization's directory service. The enterprise users are authenticated against the IDP configured
          by an organization. Virtual users can be synced with the organization's directory service and converted to enterprise users by changing their user type (`nos`) value from 6 to 2.


      **User access to iManage Work** <br>
      The ability and behaviour of a user to log in to iManage Work is determined by the following:
       * `global_users` feature flag.
       * `allow_logon` values set in the global and library level user profile.

      | global_users flag | allow_logon at Global level | allow_logon for specific library | Description                                                                                                         |
      |-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | true              | true                        | true                             | User can sign-in to iManage Work and access the specified library.                                                  |
      | true              | true                        | false                            | User can sign-in to iManage Work at global level, but cannot access the specified library.                          |
      | true              | false                       | false                            | User cannot sign-in to iManage Work at global level.                                                                |

    These items can be:<br>
      * Categories. A category is a container. It is the only container allowed in My Favorites, and they can be nested inside other categories.
      * Shortcuts. These include shortcuts to documents, containers, and workspaces.

    My Favorites shortcuts are explicitly bookmarked by the user.

  description: |+
    My Matters is a folder that displays a list of shortcuts to workspaces (also called a matter) that the user might frequently access.<br><br>
    It can be thought of as a favorites folder for workspaces.
    This folder provides a convenient location to a user for reference, search, and access commonly used workspaces.

    My Matters folder can be managed in the following ways:
    * The user can explicitly add a workspace shortcut to the My Matters folder from the workspaces the user created.<br>
    See `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/users/{userId}/my-matters/shortcuts`.<br>
    * The user can share their workspaces with others. Those users will be able to access the selected workspaces.<br>
    See `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/users/{userId}/my-matters/security`.<br>
    * The user can get access to others' workspaces by subscribing to a another user.
    This process is different than sharing a workspace, or having a workspace shared with the user.
    Subscribing is when the user explicitly selects another's workspace.<br>
    See `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/users/{userId}/my-matters/subscriptions`.<br>
    * The My Matters folder can also contain categories.
    A category is a container that holds workspaces and other categories.
    This allows for better organization of workspaces in My Matters.
    A category contained inside another category is called a subcategory.<br>

    edit_profile_date, file_create_date, file_edit_date, and document_number.
  x-tag-expanded: false

- name: Tabs
  description: |-
    To expand the scope of a workspace, you can distribute workspace content across multiple customized tabs.
    Tabs help you organize and label different types of information and make it easier to access.

    Tabs are displayed below the workspace title bar. When you click a tab, iManage Work displays the content you have stored on that tab.
    You can give tabs intuitive, user-defined labels, making them a useful tool for organizing and accessing information.
    As tabs are contained within workspaces, they can inherit profile properties and security settings from the parent workspace.
    Separate security settings can also define on the tab in order to expand or restrict user and group access.

    Important characteristics of tabs:
    * Tabs can only exist at the root level of a workspace.
    * Tabs can contain folders but not other tabs.
    * Documents cannot be placed directly under a tab, although folders inside a tab can contain documents. In contrast, folders can hold documents but not tabs.

    The trash is a location that stores deleted documents and emails. It allows for recovery of documents that were accidentally deleted.<br>

    Users can delete documents only if they have the document delete privilege from their role.
    If a user deletes a document, it is moved to the trash bin. It becomes unavailable to users.
    However, it is not permanently deleted yet. Instead, it is stored in the trash bin indefinitely.
    iManage Work system administrators manage the trash. They can restore the documents for users or delete them permanently.

    * When a document is restored, its location, metadata, and security are restored along with the document.
    * When a document or email is permanently deleted, it is purged from the system and cannot be restored.

    The following actions must be performed manually:<br>

      |Action|Description|Minimum permissions level required|

- name: Workspace Templates
  description: |
    The workspace templates collection manages the creation and use of workspace templates.<br>

    A workspace template is a definition for a workspace.
    It defines the following:
    * Container structure under a workspace.
    * Types of containers.
    * Container names, and optional prefixes or suffixes.
    * Default access level of containers.
    * If they are required, optional at the time of the workspace creation, or optional at a later time.
    * Default custom property values.

    All workspaces must be created from a template.
    That means when user create a workspace, they specify a template to base it on.
    However, restrictions for workspace templates are enforced only if the flexible folders capability is enabled.
    Often, an organization allows users to create workspaces, but it also wants to specify the container structure and other contents according to its best practices.
    Enabling flexible folders and using a workspace template, it can reliably have that control.

    If flexible folders is not enabled, the template definitions are used as a default,
    but users are permitted to use other values or to create containers without those restrictions.

    **Using workspace template requests**<br>
    The workspace templates collection includes the following requests:
    * To return a list of available workspace templates in the library, see GET `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/templates`<br>
    * To create a new workspace template in the library, see POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/template`<br>
    * To update an existing workspace template, see PUT `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/templates/{templateId}`<br>

    A new workspace template is created in two steps:

    1. Create the workspace template.<br>
    To create the basic workspace template, use POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/template`<br>
    This creates the basic workspace template but does not include containers. Those are added in the next step.

    2. Add containers.<br>
    Each container (a folder, tab, or search folder) must be added with a separate request, using the template ID as the workspace ID.
    To add containers to the basic workspace template:
    * To create a folder in a workspace template, see POST `/customers/customerId/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/folders`
    * To create a tab in a workspace template, see POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/tabs`
    * To create a search folder in a workspace template, see POST `/customers/customerId/libraries/{libraryId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/folders`

    Folders can be nested in other folders or tabs using the parent's folder ID or tab ID:<br>
    * To create a folder within another folder, see POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/folders/{folderId}/subfolders`<br>
    * To create a folder within a tab, see POST `/customers/{customerId}/libraries/{libraryId}/tabs/{tabId}/folders`<br>

    By default, all containers created through these requests will be as Required containers.
    This means they will be mandatory at the time the workspace is created.
    To add the following, iManage recommends using iManage Control Center:
    * Container creation requirements of Workspace Creation or Optional.
    See <a href="https://docs.imanage.com/cc-help/10.3.1/en/Creating_a_folder_structure.html" target="_blank">Creating a folder structure</a>.
    * Workspace and container names and optional prefixes or suffixes.
    See <a href="https://docs.imanage.com/cc-help/10.3.1/en/Name_Prefixes_and_Suffixes.html" target="_blank">Name prefixes and suffixes</a>.

    This process can also be performed in entirety from iManage Control Center **Settings > Templates**.
    For information on creating a workspace template through iManage Control Center, see <a href="https://docs.imanage.com/cc-help/10.3.1/en/Templates.html" target="_blank">Templates</a>.

    **Creating a workspace from a workspace template**<br>
    1. Create the workspace:<br>
    Use POST `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customer/100/libraries/active_us/workspaces`
    Request body:
    ```
        {
            "author: "ACASE",
            "class: "WEBDOC",
            "default_security": "public",
            "description:" "For Microsoft land acquisition",
            "name": "001 - Microsoft",
            "owner": "ACASE"
        }
    ```

    2. Add the template ID:<br>
    The `workspaceId` (`active_us!179336`) in the endpoint parameter is the `workspaceId` from the workspace created from the previous step.
    The `templateId` for the request body (active_us!179206) is the `templateID` of the template that is used to create the workspace. Use:<br>
    PATCH `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/workspaces/active_us!179336/name-value-pairs`<br>
    Request body:
    ```
        {
            "templateId": "active_us!179206"
        }
    ```

    3. Add containers:<br>
    Each container must be created separately. Use the workspaceID for the parent container.
    Use individual requests to create the child containers.
    The following request adds a folder at the root level of the workspace active_us!179206:<br>
    POST `https://www.ajubalaw.com/work/api/v2/customers/100/libraries/active_us/workspaces/active_us!179206/folders`<br>
    Request body:
    ```
        {
            "name": "Reports",
            "description" : "General reports for clients",
            "location" : "Austin, Texas",
            "default_security": "public"
        }
    ```

- name: Workspaces
  description: |-
    Workspaces are containers that are created to organize the content of an organization.
    A workspace is a root-level container that can only be created at the library level.
    A workspace can contain only folders and tabs, but not documents or other workspaces.

- name: Work Sync
  description: |-
    iManage Work sync requests allow you to perform bulk data transfers efficiently.

    Using these requests, you can synchronize the following between source and destination environments:
    * Users, groups, and roles (both global and library-level)
    * Workspace, folder tree, and documents
    * User specific worklists such as my-favorites, my-matters, my-matters-subscriptions, recent documents/workspaces
    * System settings such as applications, application settings

    The work sync endpoints are designed for application-to-application use. The application or service using these endpoints may perform
    a full synchronization or an incremental synchronization. For example, only data that has changed since a given point in time are returned.

    Although these requests appear to duplicate some functionality of other types of search requests, they are optimized for synchronization
    and are intended for synchronization-specific use cases. As a result, they require fewer parameters than other types of search requests,
    which in turn makes them unsuitable for general search purposes.

    **Important information about synchronization requests:**
    * These requests return data that was modified from an optional start date, specified as `edit_date_from` parameter, up until the current time.
    * If a cursor is also specified, the `edit_date_from` parameter is not accepted because the cursor has an embedded start time.
    * If no start time is specified, either using the parameter or in a cursor, then all results are returned.

    Note that the concept "current time" is a moving target because the caller may make multiple paged requests. The caller must execute the request
    until no records are included in the response. At that point all records that were modified from the original start time up to the time
    the last response was returned. These endpoints do not allow the caller to specify an alternate end time.

- name: Custom Domains
  description: |
    A custom domain is the public domain name owned by the customer that points to the customer portal URL for its end users to access it.

    This collection of requests enables to create and manage the custom subdomains for your iManage Cloud URL, such as *company*.cloudimanage.com.

    For example, if iManage's parent domain is `cloudimanage.com` and a customer is named Ajuba Law.
    The customer may configure a custom domain using the subdomain name as **ajuba**.
    Users can then access iManage applications using the domain as `https://ajuba.cloudimange.com/..` instead of `https://cloudimange.com/..`.

    Important characteristics of this feature:
    * Once a custom subdomain is configured, users signing in to `cloudimanage.com` will automatically be redirected to the custom subdomain URL.
      Users may also sign in directly via the custom subdomain URL (*company*.cloudimanage.com)
    * Customers can restrict the access to iManage Cloud for their account by configuring subdomains.
      As the custom domains are owned by customers, their administrators can create security profiles for the end users accessing it.
    * Customers are allowed to create 10 custom domains with unique names globally.
      Multiple custom domains accommodates corporate name changes, organization mergers, and so on,
      so that the email URLs and bookmarks generated using previous domains do not break immediately if the subdomain is changed.
    * Only one domain must be designated as the primary domain that is used to redirect interactive authentication
      requests from secondary domains as well as the iManage's parent domain.

- name: IP Address Authorizations
  description: |-
    A collection to create, read, update, and delete IP address authorizations.

    The IP address authorization feature enables customers to restrict access to CloudiManage APIs for their account to configured blocks of IP addresses.
    If there are no authorizations configured, it means that there are no restrictions on the access.

  description: |-
    Platform sync requests are similar to <a href="#tag--Work-Sync">Work sync</a> requests with the difference that they are implemented
    under the `platform` namespace instead of the default `work` namespace. They coexist alongside and function with the synchronization endpoints
    in the `work` namespace. Along with iManage Work, platform sync requests are also available across other iManage products.

    For more information that also applies to the platform sync requests, see <a href="#tag--Work-Sync">Work Sync</a>.
