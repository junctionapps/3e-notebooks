Your SQL administrator should be able to provide you a read-only account on the SQL server that houses your 3E instance. \n",

    "I should note that I'm using Jupyter Hub hosted on a Linux machine on our internal network. You are most likely running Jupyter Notebook locally on your own machine. The Hub allows me to grant a number of users access and run their own Notebooks while sharing some common utilities that I maintain. If you are on your own, you can store everything on your own machine, however, I will reference settings for the Juptyer Hub setup but I am hoping you can translate to your local setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we're publishing this to the web, I've placed my server name, database name, user and password in environment variables so they don't appear here in the Notebook. I use Linux and Systemd to start my Jupyter Hub and set the environment variables in my `/etc/systemd/system/jupyter.service` file. In my server's jupyterhub_config.py file I add any of the variables I want exposed to the individual users in the `c.Spawner.env_keep` option. Any users that I'm opening up Jupyter Hub to likely know these read only accounts anyway as they've had some SQL need in the past. Generally this would be other developers, report writers, and analysts.\n",

But lately I've been using Pandas which we'll talk about in a later Notebook which handles all of that for us. But for the curious, you can look at the available columns of the cursor in the cursor's `description` first element and you can write your own loops for the fun of it.
