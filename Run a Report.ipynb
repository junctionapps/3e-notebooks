    "# Run a report from 3E\n",
    "As we saw in the [Interacting with SQL](Interacting%20with%20SQL.ipynb) Notebook, we can run SQL commands directly against the 3E database. That's great if you know the database structure and are comfortable with it, but what if you are more comfortable running reports and exporting to Excel? We can also run reports directly using 3E's web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few libraries in Python that can call web services. I like [Zeep](https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/). If you are using virtual environments, activate your virtual environment and install it from the command line with `pip install zeep`. If that previous statement makes no sense you can try installing a package like Zeep directly from within your notebook (I suspect you'll only need to do it once and you can subsequently remove the installation code as you'll get 'already installed' errors). Use [these instructions](https://timonweb.com/tutorials/how-to-install-python-package-from-jupyter-notebook/) to see how. Basically those instructions say to create a Notebook cell like the following cell, however, on my setup running Jupyter Hub as a non-priveledged user with no shell the following fails but it may work for you. I believe `requests` will be installed automatically when `zeep` gets installed, but I'm not 100% certain so we'll also install that package. This can take some time to complete - be patient as long as there is a `*` in the square brackets to the left of the cell."

Enter a timekeeper number in the **Billing Timekeeper** field. Add a new field by clicking the **Field+** button and select **Invoice Date**.
